<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pc1">DERELICTS</p>


<p class="p2">“It’s fine!” said Arthur Warden, lowering his
binoculars so as to glut his eyes with the full
spectacle. “In fact, it’s more than fine, it’s glorious!”</p>

<p>He spoke aloud in his enthusiasm. A stout, elderly
man who stood near&mdash;a man with “retired tradesman”
writ large on face and figure&mdash;believed that the
tall, spare&ndash;built yachtsman was praising the weather.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he chortled pompously, “this is a reel
August day. <i>I</i> knew it. Fust thing this morning I
tole my missus we was in for a scorcher.”</p>

<p>Warden gradually became aware that these ineptitudes
were by way of comment. He turned and read
the weather&ndash;prophet’s label at a glance. But life was
too gracious at that moment, and he was far too well&ndash;disposed
toward all men, that he should dream of
inflicting a snub.</p>

<p>“That was rather clever of you,” he agreed genially.
“Now, though the barometer stood high, I personally
was dreading a fog three hours ago.”</p>

<p>The portly one gurgled.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a glass,” he announced. “Gev’ three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
pun’ ten for it, but there’s a barrowmeter in my bones
that’s worth a dozen o’ them things. I’ll back rheumatiz
an’ a side o’ bacon any day to beat the best glass
ever invented.”</p>

<p>All unknowing, here was the touch of genius that
makes men listen. Warden showed his interest.</p>

<p>“A side of bacon!” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Nothing to ekal it. I was in the trade,
so I know wot I’m talkin’ about. And, when you
come to think of it, why not? Pig skin an’ salt&mdash;one
of ‘em won’t have any truck wi’ damp&mdash;doesn’t want
it an’ shows it&mdash;an’ t’other sucks it up like a calf
drinkin’ milk. I’ve handled bacon in tons, every
brand in the market, an’ you can’t smoke any of ‘em
on a muggy day.”</p>

<p>“Does your theory account for the old&ndash;fashioned
notion that pigs can see the wind?”</p>

<p>The stout man considered the point. It was new
to him, and he was a Conservative.</p>

<p>“I’m better acquent wi’ bacon,” he said stubbornly.</p>

<p>“So I gather. I was only developing your very
original idea, on the principle that</p>

<p class="ppqs4 p1">“‘You may break, you may shatter, the vase if you will,<br />
But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.’”</p>

<p class="p1">The ex&ndash;bacon&ndash;factor rapped an emphatic stick on
the pavement. Though he hoped some of his friends
would see him hob&ndash;nobbing “with a swell,” he refused
to be made game of.</p>

<p>“Wot ‘as scent got to do with it?” he demanded
wrathfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Everything. Believe me, pigs have been used as
pointers. And consider the porcine love of flowers.
Why, there once was a pig named Maud because it
<i>would</i> come into the garden.”</p>

<p>Had Warden laughed he might have given the cue
that was lacking. But his clean&ndash;cut, somewhat sallow
face did not relax, and an angry man puffed away from
him in a red temper.</p>

<p>He caught scraps of soliloquy.</p>

<p>“A pig named Maud!... Did anybody ever hear
the like?... An’ becos it kem into a garden....
Might just as well ‘ave called it Maria.”</p>

<p>Then Warden, left at peace with the world, devoted
himself again to the exquisite panorama of Cowes on
a sunlit Monday of the town’s great week. In front
sparkled the waters of the Solent, the Bond Street of
ocean highways. A breath of air from the west rippled
over a strong current sweeping eastward. It merely
kissed the emerald plain into tiny facets. It was so
light a breeze that any ordinary sailing craft would
have failed to make headway against the tide, and the
gay flags and bunting of an innumerable pleasure fleet
hung sleepily from their staffs and halyards. Yet it
sufficed to bring a covey of white&ndash;winged yachts flying
back to Cowes after rounding the East Lepe buoy.
Jackyard topsails and bowsprit spinnakers preened
before it. Though almost imperceptible on shore, it
awoke these gorgeous butterflies of the sea into life and
motion. Huge 23&ndash;meter cutters, such as <i>White Heather
II</i>, <i>Brynhild</i> and <i>Nyria</i>, splendid cruisers like <i>Maoona,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
errymaid</i>, <i>Shima</i>, <i>Creole</i>, and <i>Britomart</i>, swooped
grandly into the midst of the anchored craft as though
bent on self&ndash;destruction. To the unskilled eye it
seemed a sheer miracle that any of them should emerge
from the chaos of yachts, redwings, launches, motorboats,
excursion steamers, and smaller fry that beset
their path. But Cowes is nothing if not nautical.
Those who understood knew that bowsprits and dinghies
of moored yachts would be cleared magically,
and even spinnaker booms topped to avoid lesser
obstruction. Those who did not understand&mdash;who
heard no syllable of the full and free language that
greeted an inane row&ndash;boat essaying an adventurous
crossing of the course&mdash;gazed breathlessly at these
wondrous argosies, and marveled at their escape
from disaster. Then the white fleet swept past the
mouth of the river, and vanished behind Old Castle
Point on the way to far distant buoy or light&ndash;ship
that marked the beginning of the homeward run.
And that was all&mdash;a brief flight of fairy ships&mdash;and
Cowes forthwith settled down to decorous junketing.</p>

<p>Away to the northwest a gathering of gray&ndash;hulled
monsters had thundered a royal salute of twenty&ndash;one
guns, and the smoke&ndash;cloud still lay in a blue film on
the Hampshire coast. The <i>Dreadnought</i> was hauling
at her anchors before taking a king and an emperor to
witness the prowess of her gunners. The emperor’s
private yacht, a half&ndash;fledged man&ndash;o’&ndash;war, was creeping
in the wake of the competing yachts. Perchance her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
officers might see more of British gunnery practice
than of the racing.</p>

<p>Close at hand a swarm of launches and ships’ boats
buzzed round the landing slip of the Royal Yacht Club.
The beautiful lawn and gardens were living parterres
of color, for the Castle is a famous rendezvous of well&ndash;dressed
women. Parties were assembling for luncheon
either in the clubhouse or on board the palatial vessels
in the roads. To the multitude, yachting at Cowes
consists of the blare of a starting&ndash;gun, the brief vision
of a cluster of yachts careening under an amazing press
of canvas, and, for the rest, gossip, eating, bridge&mdash;with
a picnic or a dance to eke out the afternoon and
evening.</p>

<p>Arthur Warden soon turned his back on the social
Paradise he was not privileged to enter. He was resigned
to the fact that the breeze which sent the competitors
in the various matches spinning merrily to
Spithead would not move his hired cutter a yard against
the tide. So, having nothing better to do, he sauntered
along the promenade toward the main street. On the
way he passed the one&ndash;time purveyor of bacon sitting
beside a lady who by long association had grown to
resemble him.</p>

<p>“Now I wonder if her name is Maria,” he mused.</p>

<p>Drifting with the holiday crowd, he bought some
picture postcards, a box of cigarettes, and a basket of
hothouse peaches. Being a dilettante in some respects,
he admired and became the prospective owner of the
fruit before he learned the price. There were four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
peaches in the basket, and they cost him ten shillings.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said, as the shopkeeper threw the half
sovereign carelessly into the till, “I see you have catered
for Lucullus?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, sir,” said the greengrocer affably.
“Where does he live?”</p>

<p>“He had villas at Tusculum and Neapolis.”</p>

<p>“There’s no such places in the Isle of Wight, sir.”</p>

<p>“Strange! Has not the game&ndash;dealer across the
street supplied him with peacocks’ tongues?”</p>

<p>The man grinned.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s bin gettin’ at you, sir,” he cried.</p>

<p>“True, very true. Yet, according to Horace, I sup
with Lucullus to&ndash;night.”</p>

<p>“Horace said that, did he?”</p>

<p>The greengrocer suddenly turned and peered down
a stairway.</p>

<p>“Horace!” he yelled, “who’s this here Lucullus
you’ve bin gassin’ about?”</p>

<p>A shock&ndash;headed boy appeared.</p>

<p>“Loo who?” said he.</p>

<p>Warden departed swiftly.</p>

<p>“My humor does not appeal to Cowes,” he reflected.
“I have scored two failures. Having conjured Horace
from a coal&ndash;cellar let me now confer with Diogenes in
his tub.”</p>

<p>Applied to Peter Evans, and his phenomenally small
dinghy, the phrase was a happy enough description of
the ex&ndash;pilot who owned the <i>Nancy</i>. Evans and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
craft had gone out of commission together. Both were
famous in the annals of Channel pilotage, but an accident
had deprived Peter of his left leg, so he earned a
livelihood by summer cruising round the coast, and he
was now awaiting his present employer at a quay in
the river Medina.</p>

<p>But Warden’s pace slackened again, once he was
clear of the fruiterer’s shop. Sailing was out of the
question until the breeze freshened. It was in his
mind to bid Peter meet him again at four o’clock.
Meanwhile, he would go to Newport by train, and
ramble in Parkhurst Forest for a couple of hours.
Recalling that happy&ndash;go&ndash;lucky mood in later days of
storm and stress, he tried to piece together the trivial
incidents that were even then conspiring to bring
about the great climax of his life. A pace to left or
right, a classical quip at his extravagance in the matter
of the peaches, a slight hampering of free movement
because the Portsmouth ferry&ndash;boat happened to be
disgorging some hundreds of sightseers into the main
street of West Cowes&mdash;each of these things, so insignificant,
so commonplace, helped to bring him to the
one spot on earth where fate, the enchantress, had set
her snare in the guise of a pretty girl.</p>

<p>For it was undeniably a pretty face that was lifted
to his when a young lady, detaching herself from the
living torrent that delayed him for a few seconds on
the pavement, appealed for information.</p>

<p>“Will you please tell me how I can ascertain the
berth of the yacht <i>Sans Souci</i>?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been seen that he was glib enough of speech,
yet now he was tongue&ndash;tied. In the very instant that
the girl put forward her simple request, his eyes were
fixed on the swarthy features of a Portuguese freebooter
known to him as the greatest among the many
scoundrels infesting the hinterland of Nigeria. There
was no mistaking the man. The Panama hat, spotless
linen, fashionable suit and glossy boots of a typical
visitor to Cowes certainly offered strong contrast to the
soiled garb of the balked slave&ndash;trader whom he had
driven out of a burning and blood&ndash;bespattered African
village a brief year earlier. But, on that occasion,
Arthur Warden had gazed steadily at Miguel Figuero
along the barrel of a revolver; under such circumstances
one does not forget.</p>

<p>For a little space, then, the Englishman’s imagination
wandered far afield. Instinctively he raised his
hat as he turned to the girl and repeated her concluding
words.</p>

<p>“The <i>Sans Souci</i>, did you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a steam&ndash;yacht&mdash;Mr. Baumgartner’s.”</p>

<p>She paused. Though Warden was listening now,
his wits were still wool&ndash;gathering. His subconscious
judgment was weighing Figuero’s motives in coming
to England, and, of all places, to Cowes. Of the many
men he had encountered during an active life this
inland pirate was absolutely the last he would expect
to meet during Regatta Week in the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>The girl, half aware of his obsession, became confused&mdash;even
a trifle resentful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sorry to trouble you,” she went on nervously.
“I had no idea there would be such a crowd, and I
spoke to you because&mdash;because you looked as if you
might know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Then he recovered his self&ndash;possession, and proceeded
to surprise her.</p>

<p>“I <i>do</i> know,” he broke in hurriedly. “Pray allow
me to apologize. The sun was in my eyes, and he
permits no competition. Against him, even you would
dazzle in vain. To make amends, let me take you to
the <i>Sans Souci</i>. She is moored quite close to my
cutter, and my dinghy is not fifty yards distant.”</p>

<p>The girl drew back a little. This offer of service
was rather too prompt, while its wording was peculiar,
to say the least. She was so good&ndash;looking that young
men were apt to place themselves unreservedly at her
disposal without reference to sun, moon, or stars.</p>

<p>“I think I would prefer to hire a boat,” she said
coldly. “I should explain that an officer on board
the steamer told me I ought to discover the whereabouts
of the yacht before starting, or the boatman would take
me out of my way and overcharge.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. That officer’s name was Solomon. Now,
I propose to take you straight there for nothing. Come
with me as far as the quay. One glance at Peter will
restore the confidence you have lost in me.”</p>

<p>Then he smiled, and a woman can interpret a man’s
smile with almost uncanny prescience. The whiff of
pique blew away, and she temporized.</p>

<p>“Is the <i>Sans Souci</i> a long way out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“Nearly a mile. And look! We can eat these
while Peter toils.”</p>

<p>He opened the paper bag and showed her the peaches.
She laughed lightly. Were she a Frenchwoman she
would have said, “But, sir, you are droll.” Being
English, she came to the point.</p>

<p>“Where is the quay you speak of?”</p>

<p>“Here. Close at hand.”</p>

<p>As they walked off together she discovered out of
the corner of her eye that his glance was searching the
thinning mob of her fellow passengers. She guessed
that he had recognized some person unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“Are you sure I am not trespassing on your time?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>“Quite sure. When I said the sun was in my eyes
I used poetic license. I meant the West African sun.
A man who arrived on your steamer reminded me of
Nigeria&mdash;where we&mdash;er&mdash;became acquainted.”</p>

<p>“There! You want to speak to him, of course,”
and she halted suddenly.</p>

<p>He smiled again, and held out the bag.</p>

<p>“He is a Portuguese gin&ndash;trader&mdash;and worse. And
he is gone. Would you have me run after him and
offer peaches that were meant for you?”</p>

<p>“But that is ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“Most certainly.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that. How could you possibly have
provided peaches for me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Ask the fairies who arrange these
things. Ten minutes ago I had no more notion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
buying fruit than of buying an aeroplane. Ten minutes
ago you and I had never met. Yet here we are,
you and I and the luscious four. And there is Peter,
sailing master, cook, and general factotem of the
<i>Nancy</i> cutter. Don’t you think Peter’s wooden leg
induces trust? He calls it a prop, which suggests both
moral and physical support. By the way, have you
ever noticed that wooden&ndash;legged men are invariably
fat? And Cæsar vouched for the integrity of fat men.”</p>

<p>Though the girl began to find his chatter agreeable,
she was secretly dismayed when she compared the
gigantic Peter with the diminutive dinghy. She had
never before seen so broad a man or so small a boat.
But she had grit, and was unwilling to voice her doubt.</p>

<p>“Will it hold us?” she inquired with apparent
unconcern.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. When Peter was a pilot that little craft
carried him and his two mates through many a heavy
sea. Don’t be afraid. We will put you safely on
board the <i>Sans Souci</i>. Now, you sit there and hold
the bag. I’ll take my two at once, please, as I find
room forrard.”</p>

<p>“Not much of a breeze for cruisin’, Mr. Warden,”
grinned Peter, casting an appreciative eye over the
latest addition to the <i>Nancy’s</i> muster&ndash;roll.</p>

<p>“We’re not bound for a cruise, Peter, worse luck,”
said Warden. “The young lady wishes to reach that
big yacht moored abreast of the cutter. So give way,
O heart of oak! Thou wert christened stone, yet a
good name is rather to be chosen than great riches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Peter winked solemnly at the fair unknown.</p>

<p>“He do go on, don’t he, miss?” he said.</p>

<p>The girl nodded, for ripe peach is an engrossing
fruit. She was enjoying her little adventure. It
savored of romance. Already her slight feeling of nervousness
had vanished. In her heart of hearts she
hoped that Mr. Warden might prove to be a friend
of the Baumgartners.</p>

<p>Under Peter’s powerful strokes the dinghy sped
rapidly into the open waters of the Solent. At that
hour there was but slight stir in the roadstead. Everybody
afloat seemed to be eating. Each launch and
yacht they passed held a luncheon party beneath awnings
or in a deck saloon. Through the golden stillness
came the pleasant notes of a band playing in the grounds
of the clubhouse. A bugle sounded faint and shrill
from the deck of a distant warship. Sitting in this
cockleshell of a craft, so near the glistening water that
one might trail both hands in it, was vastly agreeable
after a long journey by rail and steamer. From sea
level the girl obtained an entirely different picture of
Cowes and the Solent from that glimpsed from the
throbbing ferry&ndash;boat. The sea appeared to have risen,
the wooded hills and clusters of houses to have sunk
bodily. Already the shore was curiously remote. A
sense of brooding peace fell on her like a mantle. She
sighed, and wondered why she was so content.</p>

<p>Peter’s airy summary of his master’s habits seemed
to have cast a spell on their tongues. For fully five
minutes no one spoke. The wondrous silence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
broken only by the rhythmical clank of the oars, the
light plash of the boat’s movement, the strains of a
waltz from the Castle lawn, and the musical laughter
of women from the yachts.</p>

<p>Owing to the shortness of the dinghy, and the fact
that the girl faced Warden, with Peter intervening, the
two younger people were compelled to look at each
other occasionally. The man saw a sweetly pretty
face dowered with a rare conjunction of myosotis blue
eyes and purple eyelashes, and crowned with a mass
of dark brown hair. Accent, manner, and attire bespoke
good breeding. She was dressed well, though
simply, in blue canvas. Being somewhat of an artist,
he did not fail to note that her hat, blouse, gloves and
boots, though probably inexpensive, harmonized in
brown tints. She was young, perhaps twenty&ndash;two.
Guessing at random, he imagined her the daughter of
some country rector, and, from recent observation of
the Baumgartners, eked out by their public repute, he
admitted a certain sentiment of surprise that such
blatant parvenus should be on her visiting list.</p>

<p>For her part, the girl had long since discovered that
her self&ndash;appointed guide was an army man. West
Africa gave a hint of foreign service that was borne out
by a paleness beneath the tan of the yachtsman. A
regimental mess, too, is a university in itself, conferring
a well&ndash;defined tone, a subtle distinctiveness. Each
line of his sinewy frame told of drill, and his rather
stern face was eloquent of one accustomed to command.</p>

<p>These professional hall&ndash;marks were not lost on her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
She had mixed in circles where they were recognized.
And she was prepared to like him. In her woman’s
phrase, she thought it was “nice of him” not to question
her. She was quite sure that if they met again
ashore that afternoon he would leave her the option
of renewing or dropping their acquaintance as she
thought fit. Yet, for one so ready of speech after the
first awkward moment outside the steamer pier, it was
surprising that he should now be so taciturn.</p>

<p>When he did address her, he kept strictly to the
purpose of their expedition.</p>

<p>“That is the <i>San Souci</i>,” he said, pointing to a large
white yacht in the distance. “A splendid vessel.
Built on the Clyde, I believe?”</p>

<p>“Ay, three hunnerd tons, an’ good for ten knots in
any or’nary sea,” put in Peter.</p>

<p>“You know her, of course?” went on Warden.</p>

<p>“No. I have never before set eyes on her.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will enjoy your visit all the more, perhaps.
From last night’s indications, you should have
plenty of amusement on board.”</p>

<p>“Are there many people there, then?”</p>

<p>“I am not sure. The owners gave a big dinner
party yesterday. The launch was coming and going
at all hours.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” she asked inconsequently, indicating
with a glance a small round object bobbing merrily
westward some few yards away.</p>

<p>“It is difficult to say. Looks like a float broken
loose from a fishing net,” said Warden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir, it ain’t that,” pronounced Peter. “Nets
have corks an’ buoys, an’ that ain’t neether.”</p>

<p>“You may think it absurd,” cried the girl, “yet I
fancied just now that I caught a resemblance to a face,
a distorted black face; but it has turned round.”</p>

<p>The boatman lay on his oars, and they all looked at
the dancing yellow ball hurrying to the open sea.</p>

<p>“At first sight it suggests a piratical pumpkin,” said
Warden.</p>

<p>“But I have been watching it quite a long time, and
I am certain it is black on the other side. There!
Surely I am not mistaken. And the people on that
yacht have seen it, too.”</p>

<p>The girl’s face flushed with excitement. The thing
had really startled her, and the two men were ready to
agree that it now presented a mask&ndash;like visage, more
than half submerged, as it swirled about in a chance
eddy. That some loungers on a yacht close at hand
had also noticed it was made evident by their haste to
run down a gangway into a boat fastened alongside.</p>

<p>“After it, Peter!” cried Warden. “It is the lady’s
trover by the law of the high seas. Bend your back for
the honor of the <i>Nancy</i>. Port a bit&mdash;port. Steady
all. Keep her there.”</p>

<p>In her eagerness, the girl tried to rise to her feet.</p>

<p>“Sit still, miss,” growled Peter, laboring mightily.
“Judging by the position of that other craft, an’ from
wot I know of Mr. Warden, there’ll be a devil of a
bump in ‘arf a tick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Starboard a point,” cooed Warden, on his knees
in the bows. “Steady as she goes.”</p>

<p>Suddenly he sprang upright.</p>

<p>“Hard a&ndash;starboard!” he shouted, and leaped overboard.</p>

<p>A yell from the opposing boat, a scream from the
girl, a sharp crack as an oar&ndash;blade snapped against the
sturdy ribs of the dinghy, and the two boats shot past
each other, Peter’s prompt obedience to orders having
averted a collision.</p>

<p>“My godfather!” he roared, “’e ‘ad to jump for it.
But don’t you worry, miss&mdash;’e can swim like a herrin’.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the girl did worry, as her white face
and straining eyes well showed. Peter swung the
dinghy about so nimbly that she lost all sense of direction.
It seemed as if the laughing Solent had swallowed
Warden, and she gazed affrightedly on every side but
the right one.</p>

<p>“Oh, how could he do it?” she wailed. “I shall
never forgive myself&mdash;“</p>

<p>Then she heard a deep breath from the water behind
her, and she turned to see Warden, with blood streaming
from a gash across his forehead, swimming easily
with one hand. She whisked round and knelt on the
seat.</p>

<p>“Quick!” she cried. “Come close. I can hold
you.”</p>

<p>“Please do not be alarmed on my account,” he said
coolly. “I fear I look rather ghastly, but the injury
is nothing, a mere glancing blow from an oar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Even in her unnerved condition she could not fail to
realize that he was in no desperate plight. But she
was very frightened, and grasped his wrist tenaciously
when his fingers rested on the stern rail. Yet, even
under such trying circumstances, she was helpful.
Though half sobbing, and utterly distressed, she dipped
her handkerchief in the water and stooped until she
could wash the wound sufficiently to reveal its extent.
He was right. The skin was broken, but the cut had
no depth.</p>

<p>“Why did you behave so madly?” she asked with
quivering lips.</p>

<p>“It was method, not madness, fair maid,” he said,
smiling up at her. “Our opponents had four oars and
a light skiff against Peter’s two and a dinghy that is
broad as it is long. To equalize the handicap I had
to jump, else you would have lost your trophy. By
the way, here it is!”</p>

<p>With his disengaged hand he gave her a smooth,
highly polished oval object which proved to be a good
deal larger than it looked when afloat. The girl threw
it into the bottom of the boat without paying the least
heed to it. She was greatly flurried, and, womanlike,
wanted to box Warden’s ears for his absurd action.</p>

<p>“You have terrified me out of my wits,” she gasped.
“Can you manage to climb on board?”</p>

<p>“That would be difficult&mdash;perhaps dangerous.
Peter, pull up to the nearest ship’s ladder. Then I
can regain my perch forrard.”</p>

<p>But Peter was gazing with an extraordinary expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of awe, almost of fear, at the unusual cause of so
much commotion.</p>

<p>“Well, sink me!” he muttered, “if that ain’t Ole
Nick’s own himmidge, it’s his head stoker’s. I’ve
never seen anything like it, no, not in all my born days.
My aunt! It’s ugly enough to cause a riot.”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pc1">HOW THE MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED</p>

<p class="p2">Owing to the return of the rival boat, Peter’s agitation
passed unnoticed. A superior person was apologizing
for the accident, though inclined to tax Warden
with foolhardiness.</p>

<p>“You have only yourself to blame for that knock on
the head, which might have been far more serious than
it is,” he said.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly go to&mdash;Jericho?” said the man
in the water.</p>

<p>The superior person’s tone grew more civil when he
found that he was talking to one whom he condescended
to regard as an equal.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want any assistance?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No, thanks, unless you will allow me to use your
gangway in order to climb aboard the dinghy.”</p>

<p>“By all means. I am sorry the oar caught you.
But you annexed the prize, so I suppose you are satisfied.
What was it?”</p>

<p>“A calabash, I fancy. You will see it lying in the
boat.”</p>

<p>Peter, who was really fascinated by the carved face
which drew the girl’s attention in the first instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
suddenly kicked it and turned it upside down with his
wooden leg. The men in the second boat saw only
the glazed yellow rind of an oval gourd, some twelve
inches long and eight or nine in diameter.</p>

<p>“The pot was hardly worth the scurry,” laughed
one of them.</p>

<p>“If Greeks once strove for a crown of wild olive,
why not Englishmen for a calabash?” said Warden.</p>

<p>There was an element of the ludicrous in the unexpected
comment from a man in his predicament.
Every true&ndash;born Briton resents any remark that he
does not quite understand, and some among the
strangers grinned. The girl, still holding Warden’s
wrist as though she feared he would vanish in the
depths if she let go, darted a scornful look at them.</p>

<p>“The truth is that these gentlemen competed because
they thought they were sure to win,” she cried.</p>

<p>“It was a fair race, madam,” expostulated the
leader of the yacht’s boat.</p>

<p>“Y&ndash;yes,” she admitted. “My presence equalized
matters.”</p>

<p>As the men were four to two she scored distinctly.</p>

<p>“Give way, Peter,” said Warden. “If I laugh I
shall swallow more salt water than is good for me.”</p>

<p>He was soon seated astride the bows of the dinghy,
which Peter’s strong arms brought quickly alongside
the <i>Sans Souci</i>. By that time, the girl’s composure
was somewhat restored. Warden obviously made so
light of his ducking that she did not allude to it again.
As for the gourd, it rested at her feet, but she seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to have lost all interest in it. In truth, she was annoyed
with herself for having championed her new
friend’s cause, and thus, in a sense, condoned his
folly.</p>

<p>It did not occur to her that the <i>Sans Souci’s</i> deck was
singularly untenanted, until a gruff voice hailed the
occupants of the dinghy from the top of the gangway.</p>

<p>“Below there,” came the cry. “Wotcher want
here?”</p>

<p>The girl looked up with a flash of surprise in her
expressive face. But she answered instantly:</p>

<p>“I am Miss Evelyn Dane, and I wish to see Mrs.
Baumgartner.”</p>

<p>“She’s ashore,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Well, I must wait until she returns.”</p>

<p>“You can’t wait here.”</p>

<p>“But that is nonsense. I have come from Oxfordshire
at her request.”</p>

<p>“It don’t matter tuppence where you’ve come from.
No one is allowed aboard. Them’s my orders.”</p>

<p>Miss Dane turned bewildered eyes on Warden.</p>

<p>“How can one reason with a surly person like this?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“He is incapable of reason&mdash;he wants a hiding,”
said Warden.</p>

<p>A bewhiskered visage of the freak variety glared
down at him.</p>

<p>“Does he, you swob,” roared the apparition, “an’
oo’s goin’ to give it ‘im?”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> am. Take this lady to the saloon, and come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
with me to the cutter yonder. My man will bring
you to your bunk in five minutes, or even less.”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, Mr. Warden, do not make my
ridiculous position worse,” cried the girl, reddening
with annoyance. “Mrs. Baumgartner wrote and
urged me to see her without any delay on board this
yacht. I telegraphed her early this morning saying I
would be here soon after midday. What <i>am</i> I to do?”</p>

<p>“If I were you, I would go back to Oxfordshire,”
he said.</p>

<p>“But I cannot&mdash;at least, not until I have spoken
to her. I am&mdash;poor. I am practically engaged as
companion&mdash;another name for governess, I suspect&mdash;to
Mrs. Baumgartner’s daughter, and I dare not throw
away the chance of obtaining a good situation.”</p>

<p>Warden, who was dabbing his forehead with a
handkerchief, did not reply at once, and Evelyn Dane,
in her distress, little guessed the irrational conceit that
danced in his brain just then. But the presence of
Peter, and the torrent of sarcastic objurgation that
flowed from the guardian of the <i>Sans Souci</i>, imposed
restraint. It was on the tip of his tongue to suggest
that, under the conditions, it would be a capital notion
if they got married, and took a honeymoon cruise in
the <i>Nancy</i>!&mdash;Long afterward he wondered what
would have been the outcome of any such fantastic
proposal. Would she have listened? At any rate, it
amused him at the time to think that there was little
difference between a lover and a lunatic.</p>

<p>But he contented himself with saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“I fear I am rather light&ndash;headed to&ndash;day, Miss Dane.
Let us appeal to Peter the solid, and draw upon his
wide experience. Tell us then, O pilot, what course
shall we shape?”</p>

<p>Peter, rapidly restored to the normal by the familiar
language coming from the rail of the yacht, glanced up.</p>

<p>“If I was you, sir, I’d ax monkey&ndash;face there wot
time ‘is missis was due aboard. Mebbe the young
leddy would find her bearin’s then, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“Excellent. Do you hear, Cerberus? When does
Mrs. Baumgartner return?”</p>

<p>The watchman, taking thought, decided to suspend
his taunts.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you ax me that at fust?” he growled.
“I’m on’y obeyin’ orders. Seven o’clock, they said.
An’ it didn’t matter ‘oo kem here, if it was the Pope o’
Rome hisself, it’s as much as my place is worth to let
him aboard.”</p>

<p>“That is final, Miss Dane,” said Warden. “There
are two alternatives before you. I can either gag and
bind the person who has just spoken, thus securing by
force your admission to the yacht, or I can entertain
you on the <i>Nancy</i> until seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“But I ought to go ashore.”</p>

<p>“It is not to be dreamed of, I assure you. Cowes is
overrun with excursionists. You will be much happier
with Peter and me, and we are no mean cooks
when put on our mettle.”</p>

<p>She yielded disconsolately. Dislike of the <i>Sans
Souci</i> and every one connected with that palatial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
vessel was already germinating in her mind. If it
were not for the considerations outlined in her brief
statement to Warden she would have caught the next
ferry to Portsmouth and allowed Mrs. Baumgartner
to make other provision for her daughter’s companionship,
or tuition.</p>

<p>“Give me a call when you are let off the chain,” said
Warden pleasantly to the watchman, as the dinghy
curved apart from the yacht’s side.</p>

<p>The girl colored even more deeply. Such behavior
was not only outrageous, but it supplied a safety valve
for her own ruffled feelings.</p>

<p>“I wish you would not say such stupid things,” she
cried vehemently. “What would happen if that
wretched man took you at your word? You would
be mixed up in some horrible brawl, and wholly on my
account.”</p>

<p>“He will not come, Miss Dane,” he said sadly.
“Let me explain, however, that I prodded his thick
hide with set purpose. He is alone on the <i>Sans Souci</i>;
he blustered because he was afraid we meant to go
aboard, aye or nay. Is it not extraordinary that such
a vessel should be absolutely denuded of owner, guests,
servants, and crew? That man is not a sailor. Unless
I am greatly mistaken, he does not belong to the yacht
in any capacity. What does it mean? You may take
it from me that it is unusual, I might almost say phenomenal,
for a valuable steam&ndash;yacht in commission to
be deserted in that manner.”</p>

<p>“But he admitted that ‘they,’ meaning Mr. and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Mrs. Baumgartner, I suppose, would return early this
evening?”</p>

<p>“I am sure he is right in that. But where are the
twenty odd domestics and members of the crew?
When Peter and I went ashore at ten o’clock to&ndash;day
the <i>Sans Souci</i> was alive with people.”</p>

<p>“I only know that Mrs. Baumgartner seems to have
been thoughtless where I am concerned,” said the girl,
absorbed in her own troubles.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she brightened considerably when
Warden assisted her to reach the spotless deck of the
<i>Nancy</i>. By dint of much scrubbing and polishing,
that taut little cutter had no reason to shirk the vivid
sunlight. At the beginning of the cruise she had been
fitted with a new suit of sails and fresh cordage. For
the rest, Peter, and Peter’s fourteen&ndash;year&ndash;old son
“Chris,” roused now from sound sleep in the cabin
by his father’s loud summons, kept brass fittings and
woodwork in a spick&ndash;and&ndash;span condition that would
bear comparison with the best&ndash;found yacht in the
roadstead.</p>

<p>Miss Dane was accommodated with a camp chair
aft, while Warden dived into the cabin to change his
clothes. The boy, after a wide&ndash;eyed stare at his employer,
was about to busy himself with tying up the
dinghy, when Peter bade him be off and see to the stove
if he wished to escape a rope&ndash;ending. Chris was hurt.
He had not expected such a greeting from his revered
parent; but he disappeared instantly, and Peter imagined
that his offspring was thus prevented from investigating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the mystery of the gourd, which he took good
care to leave in the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>As for the girl, her mind was occupied to the exclusion
of all else by the strange combination of events
that brought her a guest on board the <i>Nancy</i>. She
was not so much perturbed by the absence of Mrs.
Baumgartner as by Warden’s manifest disapproval of
the lady. A railway return ticket, sufficient money in
her purse to pay for a room in a hotel, and the existence
of a friend of her mother’s in Portsmouth, a friend
whose good offices might be invoked if necessary, made
her independent. But she did not want to go back
defeated to Oxfordshire. Her father’s carelessness
had left her practically at the mercy of a stepmother,
who enjoyed the revenue of a fair estate until death.
The settlement was not to the liking of either woman,
and Evelyn was goaded into an endeavor to escape
from it by the knowledge that she was regarded as an
interloper in a house that would ultimately come into
her possession if she survived the second Mrs. Dane.</p>

<p>The well&ndash;paid appointment offered by the Baumgartners
was apparently an opening sent by the gods.
She had been strongly recommended for the post by a
friend, and there seemed to be no reason whatever why
it should not prove an ideal arrangement for both
parties. Yet Warden, unmistakably a gentleman, if
rather eccentric in his ways, evidently did not view
the mining magnate’s family with favor. That was a
displeasing fact. Though she had no personal experience
of the section of society which dubs itself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
“smart set,” she gathered that the Baumgartners
belonged to it, and it was a risky undertaking for a
young woman to constitute herself part and parcel of
the household of one of its leading members.</p>

<p>Her somewhat serious reverie was interrupted by
the grateful scent of cooking that came from a hidden
region forward. Warden reappeared in dry clothing.
The cut on his forehead was covered with a strip of
sticking plaster. He was bare&ndash;headed, and a slight
powdering of gray in his thick black hair made him
look more than his age.</p>

<p>“Our glass and china are of the pilot pattern,” he
explained, placing a laden tray on the deck, “but we
balance deficiencies in these respects by a high tone in
our cuisine. To&ndash;day’s luncheon consists of grilled
chicken and bacon, followed by meringues and figs,
while the claret was laid down last week in Plymouth.”</p>

<p>“I am so hungry that I can almost dispense with the
glass and china,” she admitted. “But won’t you let
me help? I am quite domesticated.”</p>

<p>“What? Would you rob the cook of his glory?
You must eat and admire, and thank the kindly gales
that wafted Peter to the Indian Ocean when he was
putting in his sea service, because he learned there how
to use charcoal in the galley instead of an abominable
oil lamp.”</p>

<p>“I was born in India,” she said with delightful irrelevance.</p>

<p>“Ah, were your people in the army?”</p>

<p>“No. My father was in the Indian Marine. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
he retired when I was two years old&mdash;soon after my
mother’s death. I lost him eight years later, and,
having lived thirteen years with a stepmother, I
thought it high time to begin to earn my own living.”</p>

<p>She fancied that this brief biography might encourage
him to speak of the Baumgartners, but Warden’s conversation
did not run on conventional lines.</p>

<p>“I find your career most interesting,” he said.
“Now that we know each other so well I want to hear
more of you. Promise that you will write every month
until early December, and report progress in your new
surroundings. Here is my card. A letter to the
Universities Club will always reach me.”</p>

<p>She read:&mdash;“Captain Arthur Warden, Deputy
Commissioner, Nigeria Protectorate.”</p>

<p>“Why must I stop in December?” she asked, with a
smile and a quick glance under her long eyelashes.</p>

<p>“Because I return to Nigeria about that date, and I
shall then supply a new address.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! Are we arranging a regular correspondence?”</p>

<p>“Your effusions can be absolutely curt. Just the
date and locality, and the one word ‘Happy’ or Miserable,’
as the case may be.”</p>

<p>The arrival of Chris with a grilled chicken created
a diversion. Peter had to be summoned from the
galley. He explained sheepishly that he thought the
meal was of a ceremonious character. They feasted
regally, and all went well until the unhappy Chris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
asked his father if the vegetable marrow was to be
boiled for dinner.</p>

<p>“Wot marrer?” demanded Peter unguardedly.</p>

<p>“The big one in the dinghy.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, we have never given a thought to the
calabash that created all the rumpus,” cried Warden.
“What about that black face you saw on it, Miss Dane?
I didn’t notice it afterwards. Did you?”</p>

<p>“No. I was too excited and frightened. Your son
might bring it to us now, Mr. Evans.”</p>

<p>“Beggin’ your pardon, miss, we’ll leave it till you’ve
finished lunch,” said Peter, regarding Chris with an
eye that boded unutterable things.</p>

<p>“But why, most worthy mariner?” demanded
Warden.</p>

<p>“’Cos it’s the ugliest phiz that ever grew on a nigger,”
was the astonishing answer. “It gev’ me a fair turn,
it did, an’ I’m a pretty tough subjec’. It’s enough to
stop a clock. If the young leddy takes my advice
she’ll bid me heave it overboard and let it go to the&mdash;well,
to where it rightly belongs.”</p>

<p>“It’s only an old gourd,” exclaimed Evelyn, looking
from one to the other in amused surprise.</p>

<p>“Peter,” said Warden, laughing, “you have whetted
our curiosity with rare skill. Come, now. What is
the joke?”</p>

<p>“I’m in reel earnest, sir&mdash;sink me if I ain’t. It’s&mdash;a
terror, that’s wot it is.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, produce it, and let us examine this
calabash of parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Not me!” growled Peter, hauling himself upright
with amazing rapidity. “Believe me, sir, I ‘ope you
won’t ‘ave the thing aboard the <i>Nancy</i>. Get forrard,
you,” he went on, glaring at the open&ndash;mouthed Chris.
“Start washin’ them plates, an’ keep yer silly mouth
closed, or you’ll catch somethin’ you can’t eat.”</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that the usually placid and
genial&ndash;spoken Peter was greatly perturbed. To avoid
further questioning, he stumped off to his quarters in
the fore part of the cutter, and swung himself out of
sight, while the girl endeavored vainly to estimate how
he could squeeze his huge bulk through so small a
hatchway.</p>

<p>Warden also stood up.</p>

<p>“After that there is but one course open to us,” he
said, and drew in the dinghy’s painter until he was
able to secure the gourd.</p>

<p>He was on his knees when he lifted it in both hands
and turned it round to ascertain what it was that had
so upset his stout friend. In reviewing his first impressions
subsequently, he arrived at the conclusion
that close familiarity with the features of the West
African negro must have blunted his mind to the true
significance of the hideous face that scowled at him
from the rounded surface of the calabash. He paid
heed only to the excellence of the artist&mdash;none to the
message of undying hatred of every good impulse in
mankind that was conveyed by the frowning brows,
the cruel mouth, the beady, snake&ndash;like eyes peeping
through narrow slits cut in the outer rind. Were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the lineaments those of a pure negro, he would have
imagined that some long&ndash;forgotten <i>doyen</i> of the Satsuma
school had amused himself by concentrating in a human
face all that is grotesque and horrible in the Japanese
notion of a demon. But there was no doubting the
identity of the racial type depicted. Warden could
even name the very tribe that supplied the model.
A curious crinkled ring that had formed round the
gourd near the upper part of its egg&ndash;shaped circumference
suggested the quoit&ndash;shaped ivory ornament
worn by the men of Oku. Oku used to be a plague
spot in West Africa. It is little better to&ndash;day, but its
virus is dissipated by British rule.</p>

<p>Warden’s kindling glance soon detected other important
details. The raised ring, and certain rough
protuberances that might have borne a crude likeness
to a man’s face when the gourd was in its natural state,
were utilized with almost uncanny ingenuity to lend
high relief to the carving. Indeed, the surface had
been but slightly scored with the artist’s knife. Half&ndash;lowered
eyelids, a suggestion of parted lips and broad
nostrils, some deep creases across the brutish forehead,
and a sinister droop to each corner of the mouth&mdash;these
deft touches revealed at once the sculptor’s
restraint and power. The black skin was simulated
by a smooth and shining lacquer, the ivory ring by a
scraping of the rind that laid bare the yellow pith.
No characteristic was over&ndash;accentuated. The work
offered a rare instance of the art that conceals art.</p>

<p>And Warden felt that none but an artist worthy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
rank with the elect could have conceived and carried
out this study of some fierce negro despot. That it
was a genuine portrait he did not doubt for a moment.
It seemed to him that in its creation hate and fear had
gone hand in hand with marvelous craftsmanship.
The man who exercised such cunning on the inferior
material provided by a rough&ndash;coated calabash was not
only inspired by the pride of conscious power but
meant to leave an imperishable record of a savage
tyrant in his worst aspect. A great Italian painter,
limning his idea of the Last Judgment, gratified his
spite by placing all his enemies among the legion of the
lost. This unknown master had taken a more subtle
revenge. It was possible that the black chief, had he
seen it, would have admired his counterfeit presentment.
It demanded a more cultured intelligence than
Oku society conferred to enable him to appreciate how
plainly an evil soul leered from out a dreadful mask.</p>

<p>In no respect was the truth of the image more convincing
than in the treatment of the eyes. A minute
mosaic of chalcedony was used to portray white and
iris and cornea. Small pieces of clear crystal formed
the pupils, and the rays of light glinted from their
depths with an effect that was appalling in its realism.
Thus might the eyes of a cobra sparkle with vindictive
fire. They exercised a diabolical mesmerism. Warden,
rapt in his admiration of a genuine work of art,
remained wholly unconscious of their spell till he heard
a faint gasp of horror from the girl.</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her in quick dismay. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the roses had fled from her cheeks, leaving her wan
indeed. Her own fine eyes were distended with fright.
She, like Peter Evans, gave no heed to the consummate
skill of the designer. She was fascinated at once by
that basilisk glare. It thrilled her to the core, threatened
her with immeasurable wrongs, menaced her with
the spite of a demon.</p>

<p>“This is the most wonderful thing of its kind I have
ever seen,” said Warden eagerly.</p>

<p>Though he was not yet awakened to the magnetic
influence exercised by the vile visage he could not fail
to note the girl’s consternation. He thought to reassure
her by pointing out the marvelous craft displayed
in its contriving.</p>

<p>“It is amazing in every sense,” he went on, bringing
the gourd nearer for her inspection. “Although the
calabash is of a variety unknown in West Africa, the
face gives a perfect likeness of an Oku chief. There
is a man in Oku now who might have sat to the sculptor,
though he is far from possessing the power, the tremendous
strength, of the original. Yet it seems to
me to be very old. I cannot, for the life of me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A loud crash interrupted him. Chris, removing the
remains of the feast, had gazed for an instant at the
astounding object in Warden’s hands. The boy
backed away, and tripped over a coil of rope, with
disastrous result to the crockery he was carrying.</p>

<p>Warden’s voice, no less than the laugh with which
he greeted Chris’s discomfiture, restored the poise of
the girl’s wits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“You obtained that for me, did you not?” she cried
with a curious agitation.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” said he.</p>

<p>“Then give it to me, please.”</p>

<p>He was certainly surprised, but passed the gourd to
her without further comment. She half averted her
eyes, took it unhesitatingly, and tried to pitch it into
the water. For its size, it was astonishingly light.
Were it as heavy as she imagined, it must have dropped
into the Solent several yards from the vessel. As it
was, it flew unexpectedly high, struck a rope, and fell
back on deck, whence it bounded, with the irregular
bounce of a Rugby football, right into Warden’s hands
again.</p>

<p>“That was a mad trick,” he said almost angrily.</p>

<p>“Oh, please, throw it away,” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“Throw away a rare and valuable curio! Why?”</p>

<p>“Because it will bring you nothing but ruin and
misery. Can you not see its awful meaning? Throw
it away, I implore you!”</p>

<p>“But that would be a crime, the act of a Vandal.
It may be the chiefest treasure of a connoisseur’s collection.
Would you have me ape some fanatic Mussulman
hammering to atoms a statue by Phidias?”</p>

<p>“There is no beauty in that monstrous thing. It is&mdash;bewitched.”</p>

<p>“Oh really, Miss Dane&mdash;we are in England, in
the twentieth century.”</p>

<p>He laughed indulgently, with the air of an elder
brother who had forgiven her for an exhibition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
pettish temper. He held out the calabash at arm’s
length and viewed it critically. He saw immediately
that the crown inside the ring was misplaced.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he muttered, “you did some damage,
then!”</p>

<p>Closer inspection revealed that the fall had loosened
a tightly fitting lid hitherto concealed by the varnish
used as a preservative. He removed it, and peered
within.</p>

<p>“A document!” he announced elatedly. “Perhaps,
after all, your unaccountable frenzy was a blessing in
disguise. Now, Miss Dane, we may learn what you
termed its ‘awful meaning.’ But, for pity’s sake,
don’t yield to impulse and rend the manuscript. You
have cracked his chiefship’s skull&mdash;I pray you spare
his brains.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pc1">WHEREIN A STRONG MAN YIELDS TO CIRCUMSTANCES</p>


<p class="p2">Curiosity, most potent of the primal instincts,
conquered the girl’s fear. As it happened, Warden
was still kneeling. He sat back on his heels, rested
the calabash against his knees, and withdrew a strip
of dried skin from its cunningly devised hiding&ndash;place.
It was so curled and withered that it crackled beneath
his fingers when he tried to unfold it. Quite without
premeditation, he had placed the calabash in such wise
that the negro’s features were hidden, and this fact
alone seemed to give his companion confidence.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked, watching his efforts to
persuade the twisted scroll to remain open.</p>

<p>“Parchment, and uncommonly tough and leathery
at that.”</p>

<p>He did not look up. A queer notion was forming
in his mind, and he was unwishful to meet her eyes
just then.</p>

<p>“It looks very old,” she said.</p>

<p>“A really respectable antique, I fancy. Have you
any pins&mdash;four, or more?”</p>

<p>She produced from a pocket a small hussif with its
store of sewing accessories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“A genie of the feminine order!” he cried. “I was
merely hoping for a supply of those superfluous pins
that used to lurk in my sister’s attire and only revealed
their presence when I tried to reduce her to subjection.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you have a sister?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;married&mdash;husband ranching in Montana.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile he was fastening the refractory document
to the deck. With patience, helped by half a dozen
pins, he managed to smooth it sufficiently to permit
of detailed scrutiny. The girl, wholly interested now,
knelt beside him. Any observer in a passing boat
might have imagined that they were engaged in some
profoundly devotional exercise. But the planks were
hard. Miss Dane, seeing nothing but wrinkled parchment,
yellow with age, and covered with strange
scrawls that seemed to be more a part of the actual
material than written on its surface, soon rose.</p>

<p>“Those hieroglyphics are beyond my ken,” she
explained.</p>

<p>“They are Arabic,” said Warden&mdash;“Arabic characters,
that is. The words are Latin&mdash;at least to some
extent. <i>Epistola Pauli Hebraicis</i> has the ring of old
Rome about it, even if it wears the garb of Mahomet.”</p>

<p>He straightened himself suddenly, and shouted for
Chris with such energy that the girl was startled.</p>

<p>Chris popped his head out of the fore hatch, and was
told to bring his father’s Bible, for Peter read two of
its seven hundred odd pages each day in the year.</p>

<p>Warden compared book and scroll intently during
many minutes. Miss Dane did not interrupt. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
contented herself with a somewhat prolonged investigation
of Warden’s face, or so much of it as was
visible. Then she turned away and gazed at the <i>Sans
Souci</i>. There was a wistful look in her eyes. Perhaps
she wished that circumstances had contrived to
exchange the yacht for the pilot&ndash;boat. At any rate,
she was glad he had a sister. If only she had a brother!&mdash;just
such a one!</p>

<p>At last the man’s deep, rather curt voice broke the
silence.</p>

<p>“I have solved a part of the puzzle, Miss Dane,” he
announced. “My Latinity was severely tried, but the
chapter and verse gave me the English equivalent,
and that supplied the key. Some one has that&mdash;some
one has written here portions of the 37th and 38th
verses of the eleventh chapter of St. Paul’s Epistle to
the Hebrews. Our version runs: ‘They were stoned,
they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain
with the sword ... they wandered in deserts and in
mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.’ The
remainder of the text is in yet another language&mdash;Portuguese,
I imagine&mdash;but my small lore in that
tongue is of no avail. In any case my vocabulary
could not possibly consort with the stately utterances
of St. Paul, as it consists mainly of remarks adapted
to the intelligence of a certain type of freebooter peculiar
to the West African hinterland.”</p>

<p>“What do you make of it all?” she asked.</p>

<p>“At present&mdash;nothing. It is an enigma, until I
secure a Portuguese&ndash;English dictionary. Then I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
know more. Judging by appearances, the message,
whatsoever it may be, is complete.”</p>

<p>“What sort of skin is that?”</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes slowly. She was conscious of a
curious searching quality in his glance that she had
not seen there before.</p>

<p>“It is hard to say,” he answered. And, indeed, he
spoke the literal truth, being fully assured that the
shriveled parchment pinned to the deck had once
covered the bones of a white man.</p>

<p>“The writing is funny, too,” she went on, with
charming disregard for the meaning of words.</p>

<p>“It is pricked in with a needle and Indian ink,” he
explained. “That is an indelible method,” he continued
hurriedly, seeing that she was striving to recall
something that the phrase reminded her of, and here
was a real danger of the suggestive word which had so
nearly escaped his lips being brought to her recollection.
“You see, I have been able to identify the
gentleman who served the artist as model,” and he
tapped the gourd lightly. “Therefore, I am sure that
this comes from a land where pen and ink were unknown
in the days when some unhappy Christian
fashioned such a quaint contrivance to carry his screed.”</p>

<p>“Some unhappy Christian!” she repeated. “You
mean that some European probably fell into the hands
of West African savages years and years ago, and
took this means of safeguarding a secret?”</p>

<p>“Who can tell?” he answered, picking up the calabash
and gazing steadfastly at the malignant visage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
thus brought again into the full glare of the sun. “This
fellow can almost speak. If only he could&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t,” wailed the girl. “My very heart stops
beating when I see that dreadful face. Please put it
away. If you will not throw it overboard, or smash
it to atoms, at least hide it.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” he said gruffly, fitting the loose lid into its
place. He disliked hysterical women, and, greatly to
his surprise, Evelyn Dane seemed to be rather disposed
to yield to hysteria.</p>

<p>“The more I examine this thing the more I am bewildered,”
he went on, endeavoring to cover his harshness
by an assumption of indifference. “Where in
the world did this varnish come from? It has all the
gloss and smooth texture and absence of color that one
finds on a genuine Cremona violin. The man who
mixed it must have known the recipe lost when Antonio
Stradivarius died. Are you good at dates?”</p>

<p>The suddenness of the question perplexed her.</p>

<p>“Do you mean the sort of dates that one acquired
painfully at school?” she asked. “If so, I can give
you the year of the Battle of Hastings or the signing
of Magna Charta.”</p>

<p>“The period of a great artist’s career is infinitely
more important,” he broke in. “Stradivarius was at
the height of his fame about 1700. Now, if this is the
varnish he and Amati and Guarnerius used, we have a
shadowy clue to guide us in our inquiry.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t include me in the quest,” she said
decisively. “I refuse to have anything to do with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Leave the matter to me, and that nasty calabash floats
off toward the Atlantic or sinks in the Solent, exactly
as the fates direct. Positively, I am afraid of it.”</p>

<p>“I really meant to take it out of your sight when I
caught a glint of the varnish,” he pleaded.</p>

<p>But his humility held a spice of sarcasm. Rising,
he tucked the gourd under his coat. He was half&ndash;way
down the hatch when his glance fell on the little square
of skin on the deck. Already the heat of the sun had
affected it, and two of the pins had given way. He
came back.</p>

<p>“I may as well remove the lot while I am about it,”
he said, stooping to withdraw the remaining pins.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not to be frightened by <i>that</i>,” she cried,
with a pout that was reminiscent of the schoolgirl
period.</p>

<p>He laughed, but suppressed the quip that might
have afforded some hidden satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Gourd and document are much of a muchness,”
he said carelessly.</p>

<p>The parchment curled with unexpected speed, and
caught his fingers in an uncanny grip. Without thinking
what he was doing, he shook it off as though it
were a scorpion. Then, flushing a little, he seized it,
and stuffed it into a pocket. Miss Dane missed no
item of this by&ndash;play. But she, too, could exercise the
art of self&ndash;repression, and left unuttered the words that
her heart dictated. Being a methodical person, she
gathered the pins and replaced them in the hussif. She
had just finished when Warden returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say&mdash;&mdash;” he began, but checked
himself. After all, if he harped on the subject, there
was some risk that the girl’s intuition might read a
good deal of the truth into what she had seen and
heard during the past half&ndash;hour. So he changed a
protest into a compliment.</p>

<p>“Economy is the greatest of the domestic virtues.
Now, a mere man would have waited until one of those
pins stuck into his foot as he was crossing the deck for
his morning dip, and then he would say things. By
the way, Peter believes the breeze is freshening. Would
you care for a short cruise?”</p>

<p>A delightful color suffused the girl’s face. “I feel
like lifting my eyebrows at my own behavior,” she
said, “but I must admit that I should enjoy it immensely.
Please bring me back here before six o’clock.
I wish to go on board the <i>Sans Souci</i> the moment Mrs.
Baumgartner arrives.”</p>

<p>In response to Warden’s summons, Peter and Chris
appeared on deck. The <i>Nancy</i> cast off from her buoy,
her canvas leaped to the embrace of the wind, and soon
she was slipping through the water at a spanking pace
in the direction of Portsmouth and the anchored fleet,
for the cutter could move when her sails filled.</p>

<p>Thenceforth the talk was nautical. Peter entertained
them with details of the warships or the yachts
competing in the various races. Once, by chance, the
conversation veered close to West Africa, when Warden
gave a vivid description of the sensations of the
novice who makes his first landing in a surf&ndash;boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
But Peter soon brought them back to the British Isles
by his reminiscences of boarding salt&ndash;stained and
sooty tramps in an equinoctial gale off Lundy. No
unpleasing incident marred a perfect afternoon until
tea was served, and the cutter ran to her moorings.</p>

<p>The guardian Gorgon of the <i>Sans Souci</i> watched
their return, and it was evident that his solitary vigil
was still unbroken. About half&ndash;past six, when a
swarm of yachts were beating up the roads on the turn
of the tide, a steam launch approached the <i>Sans Souci</i>
and deposited a lady and gentleman on the gangway.
They were alone. The watchman helped them to
reach the deck, a financial transaction took place
between him and the gentleman, the latter disappeared
instantly, and the watchman descended the ladder
with the evident intention of entering the launch.</p>

<p>But he hesitated, and pointed to the <i>Nancy</i>, whereupon
the lady, to whom he was speaking, looked fixedly
at the cutter and her occupants.</p>

<p>“That is Mrs. Baumgartner, I am sure,” said Evelyn
eagerly. “Will you take me across in the dinghy at
once? Then, if necessary, I can reach Portsmouth
easily this evening, as I shall have gained half an
hour.”</p>

<p>She gave no heed to the astounding fact that if these
people were really the yacht&ndash;owner and his wife they
were absolutely alone on the vessel. Warden, unwilling
to arouse distrust in her mind, bade Peter draw
the dinghy alongside.</p>

<p>“Good&ndash;by,” he said, extending his hand frankly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
“The world is small, and we shall meet again. Remember,
you have promised to write, and, in the
meantime, do not forget that if the <i>Nancy</i> or her crew
can offer you any service we are within hailing distance.”</p>

<p>“You are not leaving Cowes to&ndash;night, then?”</p>

<p>“No. To&ndash;morrow, if the wind serves, we go east,
to Brighton and Dover, and perhaps as far north as
Cromer. After that, to Holland. But no matter
where I am, I manage to secure my letters.”</p>

<p>Evelyn gave his hand a grateful little pressure.
She was not insensible of the tact that sent Peter as
her escort.</p>

<p>“You have been exceedingly good and kind to me,”
she said. “I shall never forget this most charming
day, and I shall certainly write to you. Good&ndash;by,
Chris. Good&ndash;by, dear little ship. What a pity&mdash;“
she paused and laughed with pretty embarrassment.
“I think I was going to say what a pity it is that these
pleasant hours cannot last longer&mdash;they come too
rarely in life.”</p>

<p>And with that she was gone, though she turned twice
during her short voyage, and waved a hand to the man
who was looking at her so steadily while he leaned
against the cutter’s mast and smoked in silence.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that the lady on the <i>Sans
Souci</i> was Mrs. Baumgartner. No sooner did she
realize that Miss Dane’s arrival was imminent than
she threw up her hands with a Continental affectation
of amazement and ran into the deck cabin. To all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
seeming, she bade the launch await further orders.
Baumgartner and his wife reappeared, they indulged
in gesticulations to which Warden could readily imagine
an accompaniment of harsh&ndash;sounding German,
and, evidently as the outcome of their talk, the launch
steamed away.</p>

<p>Warden smiled sourly.</p>

<p>“If those people had committed a murder on board,
and were anxious to sink their victim several fathoms
deep before anybody interfered with them, they could
hardly be more excited,” he thought. “Perhaps it
won’t do my young friend any good if I remain here
staring straight at the yacht.”</p>

<p>He busied himself with an unnecessary stowing away
of the cutter’s mainsail, but contrived to watch events
sufficiently to note that Mrs. Baumgartner received
her guest with voluble courtesy. Baumgartner, a
French&ndash;polished edition of the bacon&ndash;factor type of
man, bustled the two ladies out of sight, and thenceforth,
during more than an hour, the deck of the <i>Sans
Souci</i> was absolutely untenanted.</p>

<p>Twilight was deepening; lights began to twinkle on
shore; not a few careful captains showed riding lamps,
although the precaution was yet needless; launches
and ships’ boats were cleaving long black furrows in
the slate&ndash;blue surface of the Solent as they ferried
parties of diners from shore or yachts&mdash;but never a
sign of life was there on board the <i>Sans Souci</i>. Peter,
undisturbed by speculations anent the future of the
young lady whose presence had brightened the deck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of the <i>Nancy</i> during the afternoon, cooked an appetizing
supper. He was surprised when Warden expressed
a wish that they should eat without a light.
It did not occur to him that his employer was mounting
guard over the Baumgartners’ yacht, and meant
to have a clear field of vision while a shred of daylight
remained.</p>

<p>The progress of the meal was rudely broken in on
by Peter himself. Although the placid silence of the
night was frequently disturbed by the flapping of
propellers, his sailor’s ear caught the stealthy approach
of the one vessel that boded possible danger. Swinging
himself upright he roared:</p>

<p>“Where’s that ugly Dutchman a&ndash;comin’ to? Quick
with a light, Chris, or she’ll be on top of us!”</p>

<p>It was the Emperor’s cruiser&ndash;yacht that had so
suddenly upset his equanimity. Returning to Cowes
after convoying the yacht flotilla, she was now fully a
mile away from her usual anchorage. But the <i>Nancy</i>
was safe enough. The imperial yacht stopped at a
distance of three cables’ lengths, reversed her engines,
let go an anchor, and ran up to the chain hawser when
the hoarse rattle of its first rush had ceased.</p>

<p>Chris lost no time in producing a lantern, and his
father slung it in its proper place.</p>

<p>“It ‘ud be just our luck if we wos run down,” Warden
heard him mutter. “That nigger’s phiz we shipped
to&ndash;day is enough to sink any decent craft, blow me, if
it ain’t!”</p>

<p>Warden, whose vigil had not relaxed for an instant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
saw that some one was hoisting a masthead light on
the <i>Sans Souci</i>. Her starboard light followed, and
soon the yellow eyes of a row of closed ports stared at
him solemnly across the intervening water. As the
principal living&ndash;rooms of such a vessel must certainly
be the deck saloons, he was more than ever puzzled
by the eccentric behavior of her owners. Every other
yacht in the roadstead was brilliantly illuminated.
The <i>Sans Souci</i> alone seemed to court secrecy.</p>

<p>It has been seen that, in holiday mood, he was a
creature of impulse, nor did he lack the audacity of
prompt decision when it was called for. He showed
both qualities now by hauling the dinghy alongside
and stepping into it.</p>

<p>“Goin’ ashore, sir?” cried the surprised Peter.</p>

<p>They kept early hours on board, and Warden’s
usual habit was to be asleep by half&ndash;past nine when
the cutter was at her moorings.</p>

<p>“No. I mean to pay a call. Got a match?”</p>

<p>“Let me take you, sir.”</p>

<p>“No need, thanks. I’m bound for the <i>Sans Souci</i>.
I may be back in five minutes.”</p>

<p>He lit a cigar, cast off, and rowed himself leisurely
toward the vessel which had filled so large a space in
his thoughts ever since he met Evelyn Dane in the
street outside the steamer pier. His intent was to ask
for her, to refuse to go away unless he spoke to her,
and, when she appeared, as his well&ndash;ordered senses
told him would surely be the case, to frame some idle
excuse for the liberty he had taken. She had talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of returning to Portsmouth that evening, and it might
serve if he expressed his willingness to carry her
imaginary luggage from the quay to the railway
station. She was shrewd and tactful. She would
understand, perhaps, that he was anxious for her
welfare, and it would not embarrass her to state whether
or not his services were needed.</p>

<p>He was nearing the yacht when the red and green
eyes of a launch gleamed at him as he glanced over his
shoulder to take measure of his direction. There was
no other vessel exactly in line with the <i>Sans Souci</i>, and
the thought struck him that this might be the messenger
of the gods in so far as they busied themselves
with Miss Dane’s affairs. There was no harm in
waiting a few minutes, so he altered the dinghy’s
course in such wise that the launch, if it were actually
bound for the yacht, must pass quite closely, though
he, to all outward seeming, was in no way concerned
with its destination. His guess was justified. While
the tiny steamer was still fifty yards distant, the quick
pulsation of her engines slackened. She drew near,
and the figure of a sailor with a boat&ndash;hook in his hands
was silhouetted against the last bright strip of sky in
the northwest. She passed, and it demanded all
Arthur Warden’s cool nerve to maintain a steady pull
at the oars and smoke the cigar of British complacency
when he saw Miguel Figuero and three men of the
tribe of Oku seated in the cushioned space aft.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill060" id="ill060">ill060</a></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>He could not be mistaken. He knew the West
African hinterland so well that he could distinguish
the inhabitants of different districts by facial characteristics
slight in themselves but as clearly visible to
the eye of experience as the varying race&ndash;marks of a
Frenchman and a Norwegian. Coming thus strangely
on the heels of the discovery of that amazing calabash,
the incident was almost stupefying. The presence of
Figuero alone in Cowes was perplexing&mdash;the appearance
of three Oku blacks was a real marvel&mdash;that all
four should be visitors to the <i>Sans Souci</i> savored of
necromancy. But Warden did not hesitate. He made
certain that the strange quartette were being conveyed
to the yacht; he took care to note that their arrival was
expected, seeing that Baumgartner himself came down
the gangway with a lantern to light the way on board;
and then he pulled back to the <i>Nancy</i>. Ere he reached
her, the launch had gone shoreward again.</p>

<p>“You’ve changed your mind, sir,” was Peter’s
greeting.</p>

<p>“You were keeping a lookout, then?” said Warden.</p>

<p>“’Ave nothin’ else to do, so to speak, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, jump in and take the oars. I shall be with
you in a moment.”</p>

<p>Warden dived into the small cabin, rummaged in a
box, and produced two revolvers. He examined both
weapons carefully under the cutter’s light, and ascertained
that they were properly loaded, whereupon one
went into each of the outer pockets of his coat.</p>

<p>“Now take me to the <i>Sans Souci</i>, Peter,” he said.
“When I reach the gangway, pull off a couple of
lengths, and stand by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“What’s doin’?” asked Peter, who was by no means
unobservant.</p>

<p>“Nothing, I hope. I may have to talk big, and
twelve ounces of lead lend weight to an argument.
But I am puzzled, Peter, and I hate that condition.
You remember our nigger friend on the gourd?”</p>

<p>“Remember ‘im. Shall I ever forget ‘im?”&mdash;and
the ex&ndash;pilot spat.</p>

<p>“Well, three live members of his tribe, and the
worst Portuguese slave&ndash;trader and gin&ndash;runner now
known in West Africa, have just boarded the <i>Sans
Souci</i>. I don’t consider them fit company for Miss
Dane. What do <i>you</i> say?”</p>

<p>Peter hung on the oars.</p>

<p>“W’y not let Chris come an’ look after the dinghy?”
he said. “You may need a friendly hand w’en the
band plays.”</p>

<p>Warden laughed.</p>

<p>“We are in England, Peter,” he replied; but the
words had a far less convincing sound in his ears now
than when he protested against Evelyn Dane’s unreasoning
detestation of the carved gourd. One of the
weapons in his pockets was actually resting on the
crackling skin of a man who had been flayed alive&mdash;and
most probably so flayed by ancestors of the negroes
who were on board the <i>Sans Souci</i> at that instant.
The thought strengthened his determination to see
and speak to the girl that night. At all costs he
would persevere until she herself assured him that she
had no wish to go ashore. He even made up his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to persuade her to return to Portsmouth for the night,
and it seemed to him that no consideration could move
him from his purpose.</p>

<p>Whereat Lachesis, she who spins the thread of life,
must have smiled. Short as was the distance to be
traversed by the dinghy under the impetus of Peter
Evans’s strong arms, the cruel goddess who pays no
regard to human desires had already contrived the warp
and weft of circumstances that would deter even a
bolder man than Warden from thrusting himself
unbidden into the queer company gathered on the
yacht.</p>

<p>The pilot was pulling straight to the gangway when
a large steam launch whistled an angry warning that
he was crossing her bows. He twisted the dinghy
broadside on, and both Warden and he saw two officers
in the uniform of a foreign navy step on to the <i>Sans
Souci</i> gangway, where Baumgartner, bare&ndash;headed and
obsequious of manner, was standing to receive them.</p>

<p>The <i>Nancy’s</i> boat was so near that her occupants
could hear the millionaire’s words distinctly as he
greeted the first of his two latest visitors. He spoke
in German, and Peter was none the wiser, but Warden
understood, and his errant fears for Evelyn Dane’s
welfare were promptly merged in a very ocean of
bewilderment.</p>

<p>“The <i>Nancy</i> for us, Peter,” he murmured. “As
they say in the States, I have bitten off more than I can
chew. Do you know who that is?”</p>

<p>“Which?&mdash;the little one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe he’s the skipper of the Dutchman yonder.
That’s her launch.”</p>

<p>“He is skipper of many Dutchmen. Mr. Baumgartner
addressed him as ‘emperor.’ Give way,
Peter. We must watch and eke pray, but there are
affairs afoot&mdash;or shall I say afloat&mdash;that it behooves
not a simple official in the Nigeria Protectorate to
meddle with. God wot! I have earned a captaincy
and a year’s leave by serving my country in a humble
capacity. Let me not lose both by an act of <i>lèse
majesté</i>, and it would be none else were I to break in
on the remarkable conclave now assembled on board
the <i>Sans Souci</i>!”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pc1">FIGUERO MAKES A DISCOVERY</p>

<p class="p1">“You don’t mean to say&mdash;&mdash;” gasped Peter.</p>

<p>“I do. And the less notice we attract during the
next five minutes the better I shall be pleased. Bear
away to the nearest yacht, and let me apologize for
being late.”</p>

<p>So, if there were eyes on board the <i>Sans Souci</i> that
paid heed to aught save the coming of an august visitor,
they would have seen nothing more remarkable than a
small boat visiting at least two vessels in seemingly
unsuccessful quest of one among the hundreds of yachts
in the roadstead.</p>

<p>Following a devious route, the dinghy reached the
cutter from the port side. Warden secured a pair of
night binoculars, seated himself on the hatch, and
mounted guard over the <i>Sans Souci</i>. The cruiser’s
launch was still alongside, and the time passed slowly
until the two officers descended the gangway and were
borne swiftly in the direction of the Royal Yacht Club
landing&ndash;slip. They had been on board three&ndash;quarters
of an hour.</p>

<p>There was now so little movement afloat that the
pulsation of the screw could be heard until it was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
near the private pier. Finally it was dominated by the
strains of the Castle band beginning the evening programme
with the “Boulanger March,” and Warden
smiled as he thought how singularly inappropriate the
lively tune must sound in the ears of the potentate
hurrying shoreward.</p>

<p>The band broke off abruptly; after a brief pause it
struck up again.</p>

<p>“The King, Gord bless ‘im!” said Peter loyally.</p>

<p>“No. That is not for the King. They are playing
<i>Heil dir im Sieger Krantz</i>” said Warden, still peering
at the <i>Sans Souci</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the fust time I’ve ever heerd ‘Gord save
the King’ called <i>that</i>,” expostulated the pilot.</p>

<p>“Same tune, different words.”</p>

<p>Peter sniffed in his scorn.</p>

<p>“They’ll be sayin’ the Old Hundredth is a Dutch
hornpipe next,” he growled.</p>

<p>The Prussian National hymn might have acted as a
tocsin to Mr. Baumgartner, for a light was hoisted
forthwith over the poop of the <i>Sans Souci</i>, and Warden
discerned the tall forms of the three West African
natives standing near the tubby man who manipulated
rope and pulley. Figuero was not visible at first.
Warden began to be annoyed. Could it be possible
that such a social outcast could be left in Evelyn
Dane’s company? Developments soon relieved the
tension. A launch puffed up and took away the
visitors, Figuero being the last to step on board.
The noisy little vessel was succeeded by two boats filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
with sailors and servants. Within a few minutes the
yacht’s officers arrived, the deck saloons were brilliantly
illuminated, and the <i>Sans Souci</i> became a jeweled
palace like unto the host of her congeners in the Solent.</p>

<p>By this time Peter was as interested as his employer
in the comings and goings of their neighbors.</p>

<p>“There’s more in that than meets the eye, Mr.
Warden,” he said, rolling some tobacco between his
palms preparatory to filling his pipe.</p>

<p>“Yet a good deal has met our eyes to&ndash;night,” was
the quiet answer.</p>

<p>Peter worked his great hands methodically. He
was not a man of many words; and when he expressed
an opinion it was the outcome of calm deliberation.</p>

<p>“Tell me who them niggers an’ the other party wos,
an’ I’ll do some fair guessin’,” he said. “Rum thing,
too, that such a gazebo as that murderous&ndash;lookin’
swab on the calabash should cross our course just when
it did. Were did it come from&mdash;that’s wot I want to
know. Has there bin an earthquake? If looks
count for anythink, it might have risen straight up
from&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Peter,” broke in Warden, “I hope Chris is in
bed?”</p>

<p>The pilot laughed.</p>

<p>“Time we wos, too, sir. May I ax w’ere his black
nibs is stowed?”</p>

<p>“Among my traps. Forget it. I shall send it to
London in the morning.”</p>

<p>“An’ a good job to be rid of it. I’ve seen some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
queer fish in the sea, from bottle&ndash;nosed whales an’
sharks to dead pigs who ‘ad cut their own throats with
their fore feet by swimmin’ from a wrecked ship, but
never before ‘ave I clapped my peepers on a fizzy&ndash;mahog
like that.”</p>

<p>Twice had an unusually long speech betrayed his
irate sentiment. He was deeply stirred. Warden,
smoking and listening in silence, but never relaxing his
vigilant scrutiny of the <i>Sans Souci</i>, felt that, in very
truth, there must be some malign influence in the
carved head on the gourd ere it would arouse the intense
repugnance of two such different natures as those
of the bluff, good&ndash;tempered sailor and the dainty, well&ndash;bred
girl who had come so suddenly into his life.</p>

<p>He did not pursue the conversation. Though
Evans was quite trustworthy, there was no need to
make him a confidant in matters which might have
the gravest bearing on an already troubled position
in West Africa. The pilot’s carefully charged pipe
was nearly empty when Warden surprised him with
an abrupt question.</p>

<p>“What time does the first train leave for London in
the morning?”</p>

<p>“Round about seven o’clock,” he said.</p>

<p>“You ain’t thinkin’ of chuckin’ the cruise, I hope,
sir,” he went on, and the dejection in his voice showed
that he was prepared for the worst.</p>

<p>“For a few hours, perhaps a night&mdash;that is all.”</p>

<p>“So you b’lieve they mean mischief?” growled
Peter, jerking a thumb toward the yacht.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>This direct and forcible reasoning was unexpected.
Yet any level&ndash;headed man might have reached practically
the same conclusions from the night’s happenings.
They were clear enough to one versed in most of the
intricacies and pitfalls of West African politics, nor
did Warden endeavor to evade the point.</p>

<p>“I believe that there are people in London who
should know what you and I know,” he said slowly.
“Anyhow, let us turn in. Miss Evelyn Dane evidently
sleeps on board. Perhaps the morning’s light may
dispel some of the vapors that cloud our brains to&ndash;night.”</p>

<p>The early train from Cowes did not, however, carry
Arthur Warden among the London&ndash;bound passengers.</p>

<p>A glimpse of Evelyn on the deck of the <i>Sans Souci</i>
altered that portion of his plans. She waved a pleasant
greeting, held up both hands with the fingers spread
widely apart, and nodded her head in the direction
of the town. He took the gesture to mean that she
was going ashore at ten o’clock, and he signaled back
the information that he would precede her at nine.
Not until he found himself dawdling on the quay,
killing time as lazily as possible, did the thought
obtrude that he was extraordinarily anxious to meet
her again. Of course, it irritated him. A smart
soldier, with small means beyond his pay&mdash;with a foot
just planted on the first rung of the administrator’s
ladder in a land where life itself is too often the price
asked for higher climbing&mdash;he had no business to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
show any undue desire to cultivate the acquaintance
of young ladies so peculiarly eligible as Evelyn Dane.
He knew this so well that he scoffed at the notion, put
two knuckles between his lips, and emitted a peculiarly
shrill and compelling whistle.</p>

<p>For its special purpose&mdash;the summoning of a boy
selling newspapers&mdash;it was a sure means toward an
end. It drew the boy’s attention, even evoked his
envy. But it chanced also to be a krooboy call on
the Upper Niger, and in that capacity it brought a
lean, swarthy face to the window of a bedroom in a
quiet hotel overlooking the quay.</p>

<p>Señor Miguel Figuero looked annoyed at first. His
dark, prominent eyes searched the open space for one
of the negroes whom he expected to find there, but his
wrathful expression changed to blank incredulity
when he saw Warden. The phase of sheer unbelief
did not last long. He darted out of the room, and
rapped sharply on a neighboring door.</p>

<p>“O Loanda, M’Wanga! you fit for get up one&ndash;time,”
he shouted.</p>

<p>Crossing the corridor, he roused another dusky
gentleman, Pana by name, with the same imperative
command. Soon the four were gathered at a window
and gazing at Warden.</p>

<p>“Dep’ty Commissioner Brass River lib,” whispered
the Portuguese eagerly. “You savvy&mdash;him dat was
in Oku bush las’ year. Him captain Hausa men.
You lib for see him.”</p>

<p>“O Figuero,” said one of the negroes, seemingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
their leader, “I plenty much savvy. I see him palaver
in village.”</p>

<p>“S’pose we fit for catch ‘im?” suggested another.</p>

<p>“That fool talk here,” growled Figuero. “You lib
for see him to&ndash;day&mdash;then we catch him bush one&ndash;time.
I hear him give boat&ndash;boy whistle. Stick your
eyes on him, you pagans, an’ don’t you lib for forget&mdash;savvy?”</p>

<p>They grunted agreement. The West African
bushman has to depend almost exclusively on his
five senses for continued existence, and there was
little doubt that Arthur Warden would be recognized
by each man at any future date within
reason, no matter what uniform he wore, or how
greatly his features might be altered by hardship or
fever.</p>

<p>“Why he lib for dis place?” asked Loanda, the
chief, who remembered Warden’s part in the suppression
of a slave&ndash;raid and the punishment subsequently
inflicted on those who aided and abetted it.</p>

<p>“No savvy&mdash;yet. I lib for watch&mdash;then I savvy,”
said the Portuguese.</p>

<p>“O Figuero, I fit for chop,” murmured Pana, who
found little amusement in gazing idly at an Englishman
through a window when there were good things
to eat in the hotel.</p>

<p>“All right. Go an’ chop, but remain in room till I
come. Then I dash you one quart gin.”</p>

<p>Pana grinned.</p>

<p>“I chop one&ndash;time,” he said, and, indeed, the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
looked as though they could tackle a roasted sheep
comfortably.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Warden opened his paper and took
more interest than usual in the news. He learned that
the emperor dined on board the imperial yacht and
subsequently visited the Castle, being accompanied by
Count von Rippenbach as <i>aide&ndash;de&ndash;camp</i>.</p>

<p>Warden did not pretend to have more than a passing
knowledge of foreign politics, but he noted the
name, the Count having undoubtedly been a party to
the conference on the <i>Sans Souci</i>.</p>

<p>Another paragraph was of more immediate import,
inasmuch as it tended to solve the mystery of the calabash.
It ran:</p>

<p>“The emperor’s yacht, after watching the British
fleet at gun practice off Selsey Bill yesterday, returned
to the island and followed the racers during several
hours. An alarming incident occurred when rounding
the Foreland. Though a course was laid close
in&ndash;shore, both charts and lead showed ten fathoms of
water. Suddenly the cruiser struck. At first it was
believed that she had run into some unknown sandbank
formed by a recent gale, but examination revealed
that she had collided with a sunken wreck, invisible
even at low&ndash;water spring tide. No damage whatever
was done to the stately vessel, which continued the
cruise after a delay of a few minutes.</p>

<p>“A Sandown gentleman, passing the same spot
later in his launch, found some floating wreckage.
The pieces he brought ashore are believed to be parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of a ship dating back at least a couple of centuries, as
there is no record within modern times of any wooden
ship foundering in the locality. The gentleman in
question decided to mark the exact spot with a buoy,
and a diver’s services will be requisitioned when tide
and weather are suitable, so there is some possibility
that a number of antiques, together with a quantity
of very old timber, will be recovered.”</p>

<p>Warden read the item twice. He found that the
emperor was not on board his own yacht at the time.
The remainder of the newspaper was dull. He threw
away all but the page referring to Cowes, which he
stuffed in a pocket, and, although he held his nerves
under good control, he almost swore aloud when his
fingers touched the roll of skin, whose very existence
he had forgotten for the hour.</p>

<p>The minutes passed slowly until a gig from the <i>Sans
Souci</i> deposited Miss Dane on the wharf.</p>

<p>Not wishing to become known to any of the yacht’s
people if he could possibly avoid it, Warden strolled
away a little distance as soon as the boat appeared in
the Medina. Figuero, whose eyes had never left him
for an instant since he emitted the telltale whistle,
hurried to the door of the hotel and narrowly escaped
being discovered when Warden turned on his heel.</p>

<p>The Portuguese, an expert tracker in the bush, was
out of his element in Cowes, but he managed to slip
out of sight in good time. He was safer than he
imagined. Warden was looking at Evelyn Dane, and
she made a pretty enough picture on this fine summer’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
day to keep any man’s glance from wandering.</p>

<p>It gave him a subtle sense of joy to note the unfeigned
pleasure of her greeting. Her face mantled with a
slight color as she held out her hand.</p>

<p>“I am on my way home,” she cried, “but my train
does not leave for half an hour. It is so good of you
to wait here. I was dreading that you might row
across to the yacht&mdash;not because I did not want to
see you again, but Mr. Baumgartner made such a
point of excluding me from any knowledge of his
visitors last night that he would be positively ill if he
guessed I had friends on board the <i>Nancy</i>.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Baumgartner&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She is a dear creature, but much in awe where her
husband’s business affairs are concerned. She and I
passed the evening together. She would not hear of
my departure, but she warned me not to say a word
about my afternoon’s adventures. Mr. Baumgartner
is of a nervous disposition. I suppose he thinks all
the world is watching him because he is a rich
man.”</p>

<p>“There is method in his madness this time,” laughed
Warden. “Let me tell you quite candidly that if
some one told him my name and occupation and
added the information that I kept a close eye on the
<i>Sans Souci</i> between the hours of 5.30 and 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> last
night, he, being of plethoric habit, would be in danger
of apoplexy.”</p>

<p>They were walking to the station. Evelyn, unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to decide whether or not to take his words seriously,
gave him a shy look.</p>

<p>“You knew I was safe on board,” she said.</p>

<p>For some reason, the assumption that he was thinking
only of her caused the blood to tingle in Warden’s
veins.</p>

<p>“That is the nicest thing you could have said,” he
agreed, and she in turn felt her heart racing.</p>

<p>“Of course you are very well aware that I did not
imagine you might not be differently occupied,” she
protested.</p>

<p>“Let us not quarrel about meanings. You were
delightfully right. It is the simple fact that before
you were many minutes in the <i>Sans Souci’s</i> cabin&mdash;by
the way, where were you?”</p>

<p>“In Mrs. Baumgartner’s state&ndash;room.”</p>

<p>“Ah. Well&mdash;to continue&mdash;I was nearly coming
to take you away, <i>vi et armis</i>.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“You have no idea whom Mr. Baumgartner was
entertaining?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“The first person to reach the <i>Sans Souci</i> after
yourself was the Portuguese land&ndash;pirate I mentioned
to you yesterday. He was accompanied by three
chiefs of the men of Oku. Do you recollect my description
of the mask on the gourd?”</p>

<p>She uttered a startled little cry.</p>

<p>“Are you in earnest?” was all she could find to
say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was in deadly earnest about eight o’clock last
evening, I assure you. Had it not been for a most
amazing intervention you would certainly have heard
me demanding your instant appearance on deck.”</p>

<p>“Then what happened?”</p>

<p>“I must begin by admitting that I was worried
about you. I got into the dinghy, intending to see
you on some pretext. A launch containing this precious
gang crossed my bows, and I returned to the <i>Nancy</i>
to&mdash;to secure Peter’s assistance. We were near the
<i>Sans Souci</i> on the second trip when another launch
arrived, and there stepped on board the yacht a gentleman
whose presence assured me that you, at least,
were safe enough. You will credit that element in a
strained situation when I tell you that the latest arrival
was the emperor.”</p>

<p>“The Emperor!” she almost gasped. “Do you
mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sh&ndash;s&ndash;s&ndash;h! No names. If walls have ears, we are
surrounded by listeners. But I am not mistaken.
I saw him clearly. I heard Baumgartner’s humble
greeting. And the really remarkable fact is that
Peter and you and I share a very important state
secret.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t understand,” she said, bewildered.</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t. Not many people could
guess why the most powerful monarch on the Continent
of Europe should wish to confer with four of the ripest
scoundrels that the West African hinterland can produce.
Nevertheless, it is true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Then that is why Mrs. Baumgartner kept me
closeted in her state&ndash;room nearly two hours?”</p>

<p>“Yes. By the way, has she engaged you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She was exceedingly kind. The terms and
conditions are most generous. I rejoin the yacht and
meet her daughter at Milford next Wednesday. Then
we go to Scotland for some shooting, and the <i>Sans
Souci</i> returns to Portsmouth to be refitted for a cruise
to Madeira and the Canaries during the winter months.
Altogether, she sketched a very agreeable programme.
But you have excited my curiosity almost beyond
bounds by your description of the goings&ndash;on last night.
My share of the important state secret you spoke of
is very slight. It consists in being wholly ignorant
of it. Can you enlighten me?”</p>

<p>“There is no reason why I should not. It will
invest the Baumgartners with a romantic nimbus
which, judging solely from observations, might otherwise
be lacking.”</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>“They are pleasant people, but rather commonplace,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Well, we can talk freely in the train.”</p>

<p>“You are not leaving Cowes this morning on my
account?”</p>

<p>Perhaps her voice showed a degree of restraint.
Though she was beginning to like Captain Arthur
Warden more than she cared to admit even to herself,
he must not be allowed to believe that their friendship
could go to extremes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you don’t mind enduring my company as far as
Portsmouth, I propose to inflict it on you,” he explained
good&ndash;humoredly. “Circumstances compel me to visit
London to&ndash;day. Chris is now waiting at the station
with my bag. I would have left the island by the
first train had I not been lucky enough to see you
earlier and interpret your signal correctly.”</p>

<p>“I only intended to tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The time you would come ashore. Exactly. Why
are you vexed because we are fellow&ndash;travelers till
midday?”</p>

<p>“I am not vexed. I am delighted.”</p>

<p>“You expressed your delight with the warmth of an
iceberg.”</p>

<p>“Now you are angry with me.”</p>

<p>“Furious. But please give me your well&ndash;balanced
opinion. If peaches are good in the afternoon should
they not be better in the morning?”</p>

<p>“I <i>could</i> eat a peach,” she admitted.</p>

<p>Figuero, who did not fail to pick up the newspaper
thrown aside by Warden, followed them without any
difficulty. When they stopped at a shop in the main
street he took the opportunity to buy a copy of the torn
newspaper. Mingling with a crowd at the station,
he saw them enter a first&ndash;class carriage. His acquaintance
with the English language was practically confined
to the trader’s tongue spoken all along the West
African coast, and he had little knowledge of English
ways. But he was shrewd and tactful, and his keen
wits were at their utmost tension. Hence, he was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
at a loss how to act when he found that a ticket
examiner was visiting each compartment. Seizing a
chance that presented itself, he asked the man if
he could inform him where the pretty girl in blue
and the tall gentleman in the yachtsman’s clothes
were going, and a tip of five shillings unlocked the
official lips.</p>

<p>“The lady has a return ticket to Langton, in Oxfordshire,
and the gentleman a single to London,”
said the man.</p>

<p>Figuero did not trust his memory. He asked the
name of the first&ndash;named town again, and how to spell
it. Then he wrote something in a note&ndash;book and
hurried back to the harbor. It was essential that he
should find out what vessels these two people came
from, for the presence of a Southern Nigeria Deputy
Commissioner in Cowes was not a coincidence to be
treated lightly.</p>

<p>Seated in a tiny boat in the harbor was a rotund,
jolly&ndash;looking personage of seafaring aspect. He and
the boat were there when the larger craft which brought
the girl ashore came to the quay, but Figuero had
taken no notice of Evelyn then, because he had not the
least notion that Warden was awaiting her. Possibly
the sailor&ndash;like individual in the small boat could slake
his thirst for knowledge.</p>

<p>So he hailed him.</p>

<p>“You lib for know Capt’n Varden?” he asked, with
an ingratiating smile and a hand suggestively feeling
for a florin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wot?” said the stout man, poking out a wooden
leg as he swung round to face his questioner.</p>

<p>“You savvy&mdash;you know Capt’n Varden, a mister
who walk here one&ndash;time&mdash;just now&mdash;for long
minutes.”</p>

<p>“There’s no one of that name in these parts,” replied
Peter, who thought he identified this swarthy&ndash;faced
inquirer.</p>

<p>“Den p’raps you tell name of young lady&mdash;very
beautiful young lady&mdash;who lib for here in ship&ndash;boat
not much time past? She wear blue dress an’ brown
hat an’ brown boots.”</p>

<p>“Oh, everybody knows <i>her</i>,” grinned Peter. “She’s
Miss Polly Perkins, of Paddington Green.”</p>

<p>“You write ‘im name, an’ I dash you two shillin’,”
said Figuero eagerly.</p>

<p>Peter was about to reply that if any dashing was
to be done he could take a hand in the game
himself, but he thought better of it. Taking the
proffered note&ndash;book and pencil, he wrote the words
laboriously, and pocketed his reward with an easy conscience.</p>

<p>“When Chris heaves in sight I’ll send him back for
two pounds of steak,” he communed. “It was honestly
earned, an’ I figure on the Captain bein’ arf tickled
to death when I tell ‘im how the Portygee played me
for a sucker.”</p>

<p>Figuero hastened to the hotel, saw that his sable
friends were well supplied with gin and cigarettes,
bade them lie <i>perdu</i> till he came back, and made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
way to the quay again. Peter was still there, apparently
without occupation.</p>

<p>“You lib for take me to yacht <i>Sans Souci</i> an’ I
dash you five shillin’?” he said.</p>

<p>“Right&ndash;o, jump in,” cried Peter, but he added under
his breath, “Sink me if he don’t use a queer lingo,
but money talks.”</p>

<p>He used all his artifices to get Figuero to discuss
his business in Cowes, but he met a man who could
turn aside such conversational arrows without effort.
At any rate, Peter was now sure he was not mistaken
in believing that his fare was the “Portuguese slave&ndash;trader
and gin&ndash;runner” spoken of by Warden, and he
had not failed to notice the hotel which Figuero had
visited so hurriedly.</p>

<p>There was a check at the yacht. Mr. Baumgartner
had gone ashore, but would return for luncheon. So
Peter demanded an extra half crown for the return
journey, and met a wondering Chris with a broad
smile.</p>

<p>“You’re goin’ shoppin’, sonny,” he exclaimed.
“I’ve been earnin’ good money to&ndash;day. Sheer off for
‘arf an hour, an’ I’ll tie up the dinghy. I’ve got a
notion that a pint would be a treat.”</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that while Señor Miguel Figuero
was puzzling, even alarming the millionaire yacht&ndash;owner
with his broken talk of Captain Varden, Dep’ty
Commissioner and leader of bush expeditions&mdash;alarming
him so thoroughly that he never dreamed of associating
Miss Evelyn Dane with the Polly Perkins of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Peter’s juvenile memories&mdash;Arthur Warden himself
was driving in a hansom from Waterloo to the Foreign
Office, and wondering what new phase of existence
would open up before him when his news became known
to the men who control the destinies of Outer Britain.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pc1">A MAN AND A STORY&mdash;BOTH UNEMOTIONAL</p>

<p class="p2">Warden, running the gauntlet of doorkeepers and
other human watch&ndash;dogs, was finally ushered into the
presence of an Under Secretary. To him he detailed
his business, and, lacking neither the perception nor
the modesty that often characterize men of action, he
had barely begun to speak ere he fancied that his
recital did not command a tenth part of the interest it
warranted. Few talkers can withstand the apparent
boredom of a hearer, and Warden happened not to be
one of the few. Condensing his account of the proceedings
on board the <i>Sans Souci</i> to the barest summary,
he stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>The Under Secretary, leaning back in his chair,
rested his elbows on its comfortable arms, and pressed
together the tips of his outspread fingers. He scrutinized
his nails, and seemingly was much troubled
because he had not called in at the manicurist’s after
lunch. Nevertheless, being an Under Secretary, he
owned suave manners, and the significance of Warden’s
docket&ndash;like sentences did not escape him.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” he asked, turning his hands and
examining their backs intently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Practically all.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a while. A clock ticked softly
as if to emphasize the peace that reigned on the park
side of Whitehall.</p>

<p>“But you make certain deductions, I take it?”
murmured the official.</p>

<p>“I could hardly fail to do that, knowing West Africa
as I do,” was the curt answer. Warden was really
annoyed with the man. Without wishing him any
positive evil, he wondered how far the Foreign Office
cult would carry such an exquisite through a Bush
campaign, with its wasting fever, its appalling monotony,
its pathless wanderings midst foul swamp and
rain&ndash;soaked forest&mdash;perhaps a month’s floundering
through quagmire and jungle with a speedy end under a
shower of scrap iron fired from some bell&ndash;mouthed
cannon.</p>

<p>“Will you be good enough to favor me with them?”
purred the other, now absorbed in his palms.</p>

<p>“If I had a map&mdash;” began Warden, almost contemptuously.</p>

<p>The Under Secretary rose with a certain languid
elegance. He was really tired, having worked at the
Macedonian gendarmerie regulations until three o’clock
that morning. High on the wall, behind Warden’s
chair, were several long, narrow, mahogany cases, each
fitted with a pendent cord. The Under Secretary
pulled one, and a large map of Africa fell from its
cover.</p>

<p>“I am fairly well acquainted with the Protectorate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
but now you can talk to scale,” he said, going back to
his seat and resuming his nonchalant attitude.</p>

<p>Warden, still smarting under a sense of the evident
insignificance of Britain beyond the seas in the eyes of
its home&ndash;dwelling custodians, spoke brusquely enough.</p>

<p>“On the Benuë river, a tributary of the Niger, four
hundred miles from the coast,” he said, “you will find
the town of Giré in the Yola District. You see it is
just within the sphere of British influence. Germany
claims the opposite bank. Well, Oku is near Giré.
Oku is not on the map&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I put it there myself yesterday,” broke in the
Under Secretary.</p>

<p>Warden was gifted with keen sight. He swung
round and gave the huge sheet on the wall a closer
scrutiny. A great many corrections had been made on
it with pen and ink. They were carried out so neatly
that they resembled the engraved lettering.</p>

<p>For an instant his eyes met those of the Under Secretary;
thenceforth a better understanding reigned.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said. “Since you gave
attention to the position of Oku so recently, I am half
inclined to believe that not only my information but
my opinions are forestalled.”</p>

<p>“We have been at cross purposes,” murmured the
tired voice. “You are Captain Arthur Warden, who
commanded the Oku punitive expedition thirteen
months ago. Since early yesterday morning the
Colonial Office, at my request, has been trying to
discover your whereabouts&mdash;trying in vain, I gather&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
you would have mentioned the fact. I really
wished to consult you with reference to this very topic.
It is all the more gratifying that chance should have
led you to be a witness of events which were surmises
on our part, and that your sense of duty should bring
you here at the earliest possible moment.”</p>

<p>Warden positively blushed. It was a relief that the
Under Secretary was obviously inclined to visit his
manicurist that afternoon rather than wait till the
morrow. Such preoccupation gave him time to recover.
But he devoted no more time to silent theories
anent the disgraceful apathy of the home authorities
with reference to West African affairs.</p>

<p>“I cannot insist too strongly on the efforts that are
being made by our neighbors to undermine British
influence in that quarter,” he said. “Their traders
pander to native excesses and humor their prejudices.
Their pioneers are constantly pushing northward
toward the shores of Lake Tchad. Arms and ammunition
are being smuggled across the boundary at
many points. Preparations are quietly in progress for
a transfer of power if ever British authority shows signs
of weakening. Therefore, I draw the worst auguries
from the presence in Cowes of a clever and unscrupulous
filibuster like Figuero, especially when he acts as
bear&ndash;leader to three disaffected chiefs. Oku, as you
know, is an insignificant place, but it has one supreme
attribute that gives it among the negroes the importance
of Mecca in the Mohammedan world. It is the center
of African witchcraft. Its ju&ndash;ju men are the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
noted in the whole continent. Their fetish is deadly
and irresistible. They can compass the ruin of tribal
leaders who are immeasurably more wealthy and
powerful than any of their own men. I do not pretend
to explain the reason&mdash;I can only state the fact&mdash;but
there can be no gainsaying the simple truth that if
men of Oku place their ban on any tribe or individual,
that tribe or that man is doomed.”</p>

<p>“Can you give instances?”</p>

<p>“Yes. As far away as the river Akini, in the Yoruba
District”&mdash;and this time Warden did not point to the
map, though his words bridged six hundred miles miles&mdash;“there
was a quarrel between the up&ndash;country traders
and the shippers at Lagos. The merchants in the
interior tried to close the trade routes, but the local
chiefs refused to help them. By some means the
traders secured the Oku ban on their side. The
Yoruba natives resisted it.</p>

<p>“By Jove! both they and the factors at Lagos were
glad enough to come to heel when every ounce of stuff
was diverted into French Dahomey. There was no
overt act or threat. Oku methods are too clever for
that. The authorities were powerless. Hunger coerced
the natives, and financial loss brought the people
on the coast to terms. And this took place where we
were paramount! Heaven only knows what excesses
the Oku fetish has caused in inter&ndash;tribal wars. Why,
when I attacked them, I had to break with my own
hands every ju&ndash;ju token on the road. Not even our
Hausa troops would pass them otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“They had no ill effect on you, then?” said the other,
smiling a little.</p>

<p>“None&mdash;at present.”</p>

<p>Warden himself was surprised when his lips framed
the qualification. For no assignable cause his mind
traveled to the lowering face on the gourd, then reposing
in his portmanteau at Waterloo Station, and he
remembered the curled scrap of tattooed skin in his
pocket. He had not mentioned the calabash to the
official. Though it bore curiously on the visit of the
men of Oku to the Isle of Wight, he believed that such
a far&ndash;fetched incident would weaken his statements.
Since he was inclined at first to err so greatly in his
estimate of the Under Secretary’s knowledge of West
African politics, he was now more resolved than ever
not to bring an extravagant toy into a serious discussion.
Any reference to it would be ludicrously
out of place. He was beginning to entertain a deep
and abiding respect for the Foreign Office and its
denizens.</p>

<p>The Under Secretary asked a few additional questions
before he rose to fold up the map. Warden took
the hint, and was about to depart when he received an
unlooked&ndash;for piece of news.</p>

<p>“By the way, it is almost a certainty that Count von
Rippenbach accompanied the Emperor in the visit
paid to the <i>Sans Souci</i>?” said the official.</p>

<p>“I assume his identity solely from paragraphs in
the newspapers.”</p>

<p>“It will interest you to learn that the Count has just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
returned from an exploring and hunting trip in the
Tuburi region.”</p>

<p>Now, Tuburi lies in the no&ndash;man’s land that separates
Lake Tchad from German West Africa, and Warden
met the Under Secretary’s bored glance a second time
with quick comprehension.</p>

<p>“I think,” went on the quiet voice, “I think it would
be well if you kept the Colonial Office posted as to
your movements during the remainder of your furlough.
Personally, I expect no immediate developments.
The Emperor is a busy man. He can only
devote half an hour each year to affairs that affect the
Niger. But, keep in touch. You may be wanted.
I am exceedingly obliged to you. One learns so much
from the men who have passed their active lives in
lands which one has never seen except in dreams. I
dream here sometimes, in front of that map&mdash;and its
companions. Oh, I had almost forgotten. Do you
know Mr. Baumgartner?”</p>

<p>“Only by sight.”</p>

<p>“That is useful. It might help if you were to meet
him in some unexpected locality. And his yacht, the
<i>Sans Souci</i>, you have noted her main features, such as
the exact number of windows in her deck houses, or
the cabin ports fore and aft of the bridge?”</p>

<p>“I watched her closely many hours last night, but I
fear I missed those precise details,” laughed Warden.
“I shall correct the lapse at the earliest opportunity.”</p>

<p>“That sort of definite fact assists one’s judgment.
Paint and rig can be altered, but structural features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
remain. I recall the case of the <i>Sylph</i>, a foreign cargo&ndash;steamer
loaded to the funnel with dynamite, and about
to pass Port Said at a time when it was peculiarly
important to the British fleet that the canal should
remain open. She resembled a hundred other disreputable&ndash;looking
craft of her class, but a lieutenant on
the <i>Cossack</i> had seen her a year earlier at Bombay, and
noticed a dent in the plates on the port bow. His
haphazard memory settled a delicate and complicated
discussion in Pekin. Good morning! Don’t forget
to send your address.”</p>

<p>Standing in Downing Street to light a cigar, Warden
glanced up at the stately building he had just quitted.
His views on “red&ndash;tape” officialdom had undergone a
rapid change during the past hour. It was borne in
on him that generations of men like himself had come
from the ends of the earth to that storehouse of secrets,
and each was convinced that he alone could reveal the
solemn tidings which might be the forerunner of modern
Europe’s Battle of Armageddon. And the Under
Secretary was called on to hear every prophet! From
such a standpoint the presence in England of a
half&ndash;caste Portuguese and three full&ndash;blooded negroes
dwindled to insignificance. True, the Under Secretary
had listened, and Warden almost shivered when he
realized how narrow was his escape from committing
the grave error of discounting his hearer’s sympathy
and measure of comprehension.</p>

<p>It was not his business to ask questions, but he
gathered that others than himself were alive to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
dangers that might spring from a conference between
semi&ndash;rebellious subjects of Britain in West Africa and
the ruler of a mighty nation pent within cramped
confines for want of colonies. Oddly enough, the
bent plates of the dynamite&ndash;laden <i>Sylph</i> suggested a
strange connection between the carved gourd and the
strained position of affairs in the Cameroons. He had
no manner of doubt that when the royal yacht crashed
into a sunken wreck the previous day it liberated the
calabash, which forthwith drifted into the Solent, and
escaped notice until discovered by Evelyn Dane.
Suppose she had not seen it? All their subsequent
actions would have been affected. He might never
have known of the strange gathering on board the
yacht.</p>

<p>“Queer train of circumstances!” he thought. “If
only I could use a pen, what a romance I might contrive
with that as a beginning&mdash;and this,” he added,
when, in searching for a box of matches, his fingers
closed on the crisp roll of skin, “this as the frontispiece.”</p>

<p>He hailed a cab. He wanted to open the bag left at
the railway terminus and deposit the gourd with the
rest of his belongings in a small flat hired months ago
as a <i>pied&ndash;a&ndash;terre</i>. His stock of cigars needed replenishing,
and the weird document that had just made its
presence felt reminded him that a Portuguese dictionary
was lacking. A glance at his watch showed
that he could not reach Cowes until a late hour, so he
resolved to pass the night in town, go to a theatre, and
return to the <i>Nancy</i> next morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>From Waterloo, therefore, he telegraphed to Peter:</p>

<p>“Remaining here until to&ndash;morrow. Keep your
weather eye open.”</p>

<p>He was sure that his friendly factotum would grasp
the full meaning of the second sentence, but he would
have been the most surprised man in London could he
have known that Peter at that moment was plying the
three men of Oku with gin.</p>

<p>An accident brought about a slight variation of his
plans. It happened that no other passenger claimed
the attention of the luggage&ndash;room clerk at Waterloo
when the portmanteau was unlocked. Warden deposited
the gourd on the zinc counter and groped
among his belongings for something to cover it.</p>

<p>The attendant, who was watching him, uttered a
gasping exclamation.</p>

<p>“Good Lord! sir,” he cried, “what sort of horrible
thing is that?”</p>

<p>It was then that a hitherto undiscovered property
in the gourd brought itself in evidence. No sooner
was it placed on a smooth surface than it promptly
wobbled into a half upright position, with the negro’s
face on the upper part. Chance could hardly accomplish
this movement. It was the designer’s intent,
brought about by concealed weights, and Warden
instantly remembered that the calabash floated much
deeper in the water than would have been the case
otherwise. A shaft of sunlight came through a broken
pane in the glass roof, and fell directly on the scowling
apparition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect on the clerk was phenomenal. He grew
livid, and backed away from the counter.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the limit,” he muttered. “If I’d ha’
known old Hoof an’ Horns was so near to me since I
kem on duty I’d ‘ave gone sick.”</p>

<p>Warden laughed, stuffed the gourd into the portmanteau,
and hurried to the waiting cab. So preoccupied
was he with other matters, he had not realized
earlier that under the new conditions he would be in
need of some portion of the bag’s contents.</p>

<p>It was no easy task to find a Portuguese&ndash;English
dictionary. He tried half a dozen booksellers in vain,
but ultimately unearthed a serviceable volume at a
second&ndash;hand shop in Charing Cross Road. By the
time he reached his flat, five o’clock, he was desperately
hungry, having eaten nothing since breakfast.</p>

<p>His rooms looked dismal, and an apologetic hall&ndash;porter
explained that if the gentleman ‘ad on’y sent a
wire he’d ha’ tidied the place up a bit. Warden went
to a restaurant, dined well, and returned at half&ndash;past
six. There was still an hour or more of daylight, so
he began to decipher the unsolved section of the strange
manuscript. It was a longer job than he anticipated.
Arabic characters, being largely phonetic, do not give
a literal rendering of European words. Many pages
of the dictionary were searched ere he hit upon the
exact rendering of the blurred phrases. But the quest
fascinated him. Before it was ended he found it
necessary to consult an atlas and an encyclopedia.</p>

<p>At last, allowing for a margin of error in his guesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
at tenses and other variants of root words, he completed
a translation, and this is what he had written:</p>

<p>“I, Domenico Garcia, artist and musician in the
city of Lisbon, am justly punished for my sins. Being
desperate and needy, I joined in an attack on the <i>Santo
Espirito</i>, homeward&ndash;bound from the Indies, and helped
in the slaying of all the ship’s company. We attacked
her when she left Lisbon on the voyage to Oporto, but
a great gale from the northeast drove us far out to sea,
and then the wind veered to the northwest, and cast
us miserably ashore on the African desert. We abode
there many days, and saw no means of succor, so we
buried most of our ill&ndash;gotten gains in that unknown
place and turned our faces to the north, thinking to
find a Portuguese settlement in the land of the Moors.
We died one by one, some from hunger, some from
fever, some from the ravages of wild beasts. Six out
of fifty&ndash;four men reached the town of Rabat in the
train of a Moorish merchant. There we were sold as
slaves. Three were dead within a month. We who
were left, Tommaso Rodriguez, Manoel of Serpa and
myself, were sent as presents over the caravan road to
that cruel tyrant the black king of Benin. Rodriguez
went mad, and was flayed alive for refusing to worship
a heathen god. This message is written on his skin.
Manoel of Serpa was drowned in the river which these
monsters term ‘Mother of Waters,’ while I, though my
life is preserved by reason of my skill in carving, am
utterly bereft of hope in this world while filled with
fear of God’s justice in the next. Christian, you who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
read these words, for which I have devised a cunning
receptacle that may long survive me, if you would help
an erring brother to regain salvation, go yourself, or
send some trusty person, to the above&ndash;named town of
Rabat. I hid there a great ruby which I took from a
golden pyx found on board the <i>Santo Espirito</i>. It lies
in the Hassan Tower, the tomb of an infidel buried
outside the walls. A causeway leads to the door,
which is three cubits from the ground, and my ruby
is in a deep crack between the center stones of the sill
of the third window on the left. I placed it there for
safety, thinking that perchance I might escape and
secure it again. Friend, I am many marches from
Rabat but few from death. Find that gem of great
price, and cause masses to be said for my soul in the
Cathedral of the Patriarch at Lisbon. Inscribed by
me, the unhappy Domenico Garcia, in the year 1634,
to pleasure that loathly barbarian, M’Wanga, King of
Benin, who holds that writing on a white man’s skin is
most potent magic against fever, even while I, the
alchemist, am yielding to its ravages.”</p>

<p>The violet&ndash;tinted gloom that marks the close of a
fine summer’s day in London was filling the room
with its shadows when Warden had written the last
words of a fair copy. He lit a cigar, placed an easy
chair so that he might sit with his back to the window,
and was about to analyze the queer document which
had fallen into his hands in such an extraordinary
manner when he noticed that the face on the gourd,
though tilted on the table exactly in the same fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
as on the counter of the luggage&ndash;room at Waterloo,
appeared to be watching him. Now, no man of strong
nervous power likes to feel startled, and that the stealthy
menace in those evil eyes was startling he did not
attempt to deny. He had not noticed previously that&mdash;no
matter what the angle&mdash;so long as the eyes
were visible they seemed to look fixedly at the beholder.
Thinking that the waning light was deceptive, he
sprang up and built some books into a V&ndash;shaped support
that enabled him to set the scowling face in many
positions. The varying tests all had the same result.
The snake&ndash;like glance followed him everywhere. The
very orbs appeared to turn in the head. In the deepening
twilight they seemed to gleam with a dull fire,
and Warden was absolutely forced to reason himself
out of the expectation that soon those brutal lips would
open and overwhelm him with threats.</p>

<p>“Confound you!” he muttered, scarce knowing
whether to laugh or fly into a rage at the foolish fancy
that led him to address a carven mask, “if you looked
that way at poor Domenico Garcia it is not surprising
that he should use his comrade’s skin as vellum. You
black beauty! Are there any of your breed left in
Nigeria, I wonder?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>It demanded almost an effort to sink into the chair
and disregard the sinister object glaring at him from
the table. He picked up the sheet of note&ndash;paper
containing the translation and set his mind to its proper
understanding. While intent on the intricacies of
cases and genders&mdash;difficulties intensified by the use
of archaic phrases and the Arabic script&mdash;he had
given but passing thought to the general drift of the
words. True, the reference to a river named “Mother
of Waters” was amazing, because that was the native
name for the Benuë, while a search through the encyclopedia
showed that the seaport town of Rabat, in
Morocco, was famous for its ruined monuments. But
now, pondering each sentence, he became alive to their
tremendous significance. Their very simplicity was
the best witness to the underlying tragedy. A man
who dismissed the massacre on board the <i>Santo Espirito</i>
with the curt statement that he “helped in the slaying
of all the ship’s company,” was not likely to use unnecessary
adjectives. “Six out of fifty&ndash;four” was also a
summary magnificent in its brevity. Garcia reached
the sheer apex of the direct narrative style when he
said that he and Rodriguez, and Manoel of Serpa, were
sent as presents to the King of Benin “over the caravan
route.” Those four words covered a journey of 2500
miles across mountains, deserts, and jungle&ndash;covered
swamps, where road there was none, and towns, even
the most wretched communities of savages, were hundreds
of miles apart. The track probably led through
Bel Abbas, Taudeni, and Timbuctu, traversing the
very heart of the Sahara, a region so forbidding and
inhospitable that even to&ndash;day it remains one of the
secret places of the world.</p>

<p>And again, there was a grim humor discoverable in
a man who, concentrating his life’s story into so few
words, could yet indulge his mordant wit by writing:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
“I am many marches from Rabat but few from death,”
and even poke a bitter jest at M’Wanga for his fantastic
notion of a specific against backwater fever!</p>

<p>It was a forceful picture that Warden conceived
when in his mind’s eye he saw the “artist and musician,”
and ex&ndash;pirate, too, sitting in the shade of a giant
tree near the king’s hut, and pricking out with needle
and dyes, on parchment torn from the back of his
dead comrade, the record of those terrible years. He
could limn the hollow cheeks, the wasted frame, the
fever&ndash;light in the dark eyes, and the melancholy smile
that must have lifted the cloud of suffering for a little
while when the concluding lines were written. Warden
knew the scene so intimately that if he put pencil to
paper, and Garcia’s long&ndash;forgotten shade were permitted
to testify to the accuracy of the sketch, there
could be no reasonable doubt that imagination must
have come very near the truth.</p>

<p>Though the Portuguese did not say as much, it was
not hard to guess that the “cunning receptacle” he
had devised for his last manuscript was the graven
image of M’Wanga himself. His artist’s eye had caught
the possibilities of the curiously&ndash;shaped gourd, and,
as he said in his own way, he had used his “skill in
carving” as a means of preservation&mdash;perhaps of
securing a certain measure of good treatment. No
doubt the King of Benin, sitting on the state stool in
front of his palace of mats and wattle, was greatly
flattered by the portrait. He would appreciate its
realism while missing its subtle irony. In the circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of subordinate chiefs and witch&ndash;doctors surrounding
him there must have been many who hated the white
man because he won the royal favor even for a moment.
But they would be wary, and join loudly in the chorus
of praise, for there was a grove near by in which the
latest victims of M’Wanga’s wrath fouled the air with
their dead bodies.</p>

<p>Garcia’s description of the black ruler as “King of
Benin” puzzled Warden at first. Modern Benin was
far enough removed from Oku and the upper reaches
of the Benuë to render the title vague and seemingly
mistaken.</p>

<p>Yet Garcia’s sparse record already promised an
astounding truthfulness. Warden was quite sure he
would discover some contemporary proof of the loss
of the <i>Santo Espirito</i>. He believed that any one who
visited the tomb of Hassan beyond the walls of Rabat
would find the ruby placed there nearly one hundred
and eighty years ago. Why, then, should the chronicler
err in his allusion to M’Wanga’s rank?</p>

<p>M’Wanga’s counterfeit answered the unspoken question.
Warden happened to look at the calabash, now
hardly visible in the ever&ndash;increasing darkness. But
the cruel eyes still glinted at him, and he could almost
discover a sardonic grin on the thick lips.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he muttered, “When that fellow reigned
in Benin his empire spread as far as his reputation.
I have no manner of doubt but he lived in the interior,
where it is healthier than on the coast. Yes, you man&ndash;devil!”
he added, leaping excitedly to his feet as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
new and discomforting thought possessed him. “You
did mischief enough during your evil life, and now you
have resurrected yourself just in time to take a silent
part in more of the wild doings in which you would
have gloried.”</p>

<p>For he was spurred to this sudden outburst by the
knowledge that not only did political trouble loom
across the West African sky, but that he, and he only,
was the Christian and friend to whom Domenico
Garcia made his dying appeal. There was a ruby of
great price to be won, and masses to be said in the
Cathedral of the Patriarch at Lisbon. Could he refuse
to fulfil the terms of that pathetic bequest? He had
nearly six months of unexpired furlough at disposal,
and the Under Secretary did not appear to have any
dread of immediate developments in Nigeria, such as
would demand the recall of officers to their duties.
What argument would convince his own mind that he
might justly decline an almost intolerable legacy?</p>

<p>Well, he would go into the pros and cons of a doubtful
problem later. He was not a rich man, and the
journey to Rabat and back would probably be very
expensive. Certainly that ruby would look very well
on the white throat of Evelyn Dane, though people
might well wonder how the wife of a poorly&ndash;paid official
could afford to wear a “gem of great price.”</p>

<p>The conceit so tickled him that he laughed, laughed
all the louder, perhaps, because he was conscious that
the black king of Benin was scoffing at him maliciously
from the table. But the glee died in his throat when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
a thunderous double rat&ndash;tat shook the outer door of
the flat, and Warden was prepared, for one thrilling
instant, to fight a legion of ghosts and demons if need
be. Then his scattered wits told him that His Majesty’s
post demanded his appearance. He struck a match,
lighted the gas, and went to the door, where a small
boy, who seemed to be physically incapable of using a
knocker with such vehemence, handed him a telegram.</p>

<p>It was brief and to the point:</p>

<p>“<i>Sans Souci</i> sailed 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Niggers and friend left
for London 6.30. Thought you would like to know.
Peter.”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pc1">WHEREIN WARDEN SETS A NEW COURSE</p>

<p class="p2">Warden’s theatre&ndash;going that evening resolved itself
into a stroll in the park and an early return to his
chambers. Before going out, he had thrown a towel
over the calabash, and told the porter not to touch
anything in the sitting&ndash;room. The plan was effective;
the man of Oku created no disturbance.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the young officer was now beginning
to understand the mesmeric influence which Evelyn
Dane and Peter Evans acknowledged instantly&mdash;and
with this admission came the consciousness that
the negro’s mask lost its power unless actually in evidence.
Hence, none of the vapors and misty fancies
of the preceding hours interfered with his rest. He
slept soundly, rose betimes, and ate a good breakfast&mdash;unfailing
signs these of a sound mind in a sound
body.</p>

<p>Yet he might have been puzzled if called on to explain
why he deliberately placed the gourd in a sponge&ndash;bag,
and put it in his portmanteau before returning to the
Isle of Wight. His action was, perhaps, governed by
some sense of the fitness of things. If it were ordained
that the presentment of the dead and gone M’Wanga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
should scowl again at the world during a period when
the fortunes of his country were at stake, it was not for
Warden to disobey the silent edict. He was not swayed
solely by idle impulse. In bringing the head to London
he meant to please the only people who knew of
its existence; he ignored their wishes now because he
felt a tugging at his heart&ndash;strings when his thoughts
reverted to the wretched history of Domenico Garcia.
The instant he arrived at this decision it ceased to
trouble his mind further.</p>

<p>Before going to the station he made a few purchases,
and, being near Pall Mall, thought he would secure
any letters that might happen to be at his club. Among
others, he found a pressing invitation from Lady Hilbury
asking him to call when in London. Now, he
was, in a degree, a protégé of her ladyship. Her husband
was a former governor of Nigeria, and her friendly
assistance had helped, in the first instance, to lift
Warden out of the ruck of youngsters who yearly
replete the ranks of officialdom in West Africa. It was
more than probable that Sir Charles and Lady Hilbury
would be out of town, and a note written at their residence
would show that he visited them at the earliest
opportunity.</p>

<p>To his surprise, Lady Hilbury was at home, and
insisted that he should stay for luncheon.</p>

<p>Behold, then, Warden installed in a cozy morning&ndash;room,
exchanging gossip with his hostess, and his
parcels and portmanteau given over to the butler’s
care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>He was irrevocably committed to an afternoon train
when Lady Hilbury electrified him with a morsel of
news that was as unexpected as any other shock that
had befallen him of late.</p>

<p>“By the way, an old friend of yours is staying with
me,” she said&mdash;“Mrs. Laing&mdash;you knew her better
as Rosamund Miller, I fancy?”</p>

<p>Warden schooled his features into a passable imitation
of a smile. Mrs. Laing&mdash;the pretty, irresponsible
Rosamund Miller&mdash;was the last person he wished to
encounter, but he was quick to see the twinkle in Lady
Hilbury’s eyes, and he accepted the inevitable.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to renew the acquaintance,” he said.
“It was broken off rather abruptly&mdash;at Government
House if I remember aright.”</p>

<p>“Poor Rosamund! That was her mother’s contriving.
She never really liked Laing, but he was
what people term ‘a good match,’ and he has at least
justified that estimate of his worth by dying suddenly
and leaving his widow nearly two hundred thousand
pounds.”</p>

<p>“A most considerate man,” murmured Warden.</p>

<p>“Then you have not forgiven her?”</p>

<p>“Forgive! What a harsh word from your lips.
Pray consider. On your own estimate she owes me
two hundred thousand thanks.”</p>

<p>“Arthur, I don’t like you as a cynic. I am old
enough to be your mother. Indeed, it was my love
for your mother that first led me to take an interest in
your welfare, and I should be doing wrong if I hid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
from you the fact that it nearly broke Rosamund’s
heart to throw you over.”</p>

<p>“I trust the lapse of years has healed the fracture,”
he said.</p>

<p>Lady Hilbury looked at him in silence for a moment.
She remembered the white&ndash;faced subaltern who heard,
at her hospitable table, that Rosamund Miller had
married a wealthy planter at Madeira&mdash;married him
suddenly, within a month after her departure from the
coast.</p>

<p>“Is there another woman?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p>“Not single spies but whole battalions. How I
have managed to escape their combined charms all
these years is a marvel. Seriously, Lady Hilbury, you
would not have me take a wife to my special swamp,
and I would not care to leave her in England drawing
half my pay. All my little luxuries would vanish at
one fell swoop.”</p>

<p>“I would like to see you happy, Arthur, and there is
always the possibility of marrying some one who would
demand no sacrifices.”</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Laing out?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes. Of course you want to meet her again?”</p>

<p>“I think not. I don’t mean to be unkind, but the
tender recollections I cherish are too dear to be replaced
by a fresh set.”</p>

<p>“That sounds theatrical&mdash;a sarcastic line out of
some comedy of manners. If so, you shall have a wider
stage than my boudoir. We lunch at one o’clock.
It is 12.45 now, and Rosamund is always punctual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Warden, though raging at the dilemma, made the
best of it.</p>

<p>“How long has Mrs. Laing been a widow?” he said.</p>

<p>“Nearly a year. Evidently your bush campaign
shut out the usual sources of intelligence.”</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>“I really must catch the three o’clock train to
Cowes,” he explained. “I am on Government service,
and I suppose it would be quite impossible to arrange
everything in a couple of hours. I am unacquainted
with the formalities, but even a special license demands&mdash;“</p>

<p>“How unkind! Arthur, what has happened to
you? How you are changed!”</p>

<p>“Never changed where you are concerned, Lady
Hilbury!” he cried, sentiment for once gaining the
upper hand&mdash;“you, to whom I owe so much! That,
indeed, would be the wintry wind of ingratitude.
Now, let me make amends. My behavior shall be
discreet&mdash;my decorous sympathy worthy of a High
Church curate. I was staggered for a few seconds,
I admit, but the effects of the blow have passed, and
my best excuse is that other things are perplexing me.
I have no secrets from you, you know, so let me tell
you why I am here.”</p>

<p>Sure of an interested listener in the wife of an ex&ndash;ruler
of the great Niger territory, Warden plunged into
an account of recent events. It was not necessary to
mention Evelyn Dane in order to hold her attention.
The first reference to Figuero and the Oku chiefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
attained that end. No mean diplomatist herself, Lady
Hilbury understood much that would perforce be
hidden from all save those acquainted with West
Africa.</p>

<p>“You will permit me to tell Charles?” came the
eager question when he had finished.</p>

<p>“Of course. Why not?”</p>

<p>“There are those in the administration who are
jealous of his record,” she said. “Not every one has
his tact in dealing with natives. It is no secret that our
relations with the emirs of the interior have been
strained almost to breaking point of late&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A motor stopped outside the house and a bell rang.
Lady Hilbury bent forward. Her voice sank to a new
note of intense conviction.</p>

<p>“You have been given a great opportunity, Arthur.
It may come sooner than you think. Grasp it firmly.
Let no man supplant you, and it will carry you far.”</p>

<p>Her ladyship’s manner no less than her earnest
words told Warden that there were forces in motion of
which he was yet in complete ignorance. It was
sufficiently puzzling to find an Under Secretary so well
informed as to the identity of certain visitors to Cowes,
but when a woman in the position of his hostess&mdash;with
her wide experience of the seldom&ndash;seen workings
of the political machine&mdash;went out of her way to congratulate
him on a “great opportunity,” he was thrilled
with a sudden elation.</p>

<p>Thus, when his hand closed on that of Rosamund
Laing, there was a flush on his bronzed face, a glint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of power and confidence in his eyes, that might well be
misinterpreted by a woman startled almost to the verge
of incoherence.</p>

<p>When she asked where Lady Hilbury was, and if she
were alone, the footman merely announced the fact that
a gentleman had called and would make one of the
luncheon party. Rosamund entered the boudoir with
an air of charming impulsiveness practised so sedulously
that it had long ceased to be artificial. For once in
her life it abandoned her. Warden’s friendly greeting
was such a bolt from the blue that she faltered, paled
and blushed alternately, and actually stammered a few
broken words with the shy diffidence of a schoolgirl.</p>

<p>The phase of embarrassment passed as quickly as
it had arisen. Both the man and the woman were too
well&ndash;bred to permit the shadows of the past to darken
the present. Lady Hilbury, too, rose to the occasion,
and they were soon chatting with the unrestrained
freedom of old and close acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>Then Warden discovered that the lively impetuous
girl who taught him the first sharp lesson in life’s disillusionment
had developed into a beautiful, self&ndash;possessed,
almost intellectual woman of the world.
She was gowned with that unobtrusive excellence
which betokens perfect taste and a well&ndash;lined purse.
Certain little hints in her costume showed that the
memory of her late husband did not press too heavily
upon her. The fashionable modiste can lend periodicity
to grief, and Mrs. Laing was passing through the
heliotrope stage of widowhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Her exquisite complexion was certainly somewhat
bewildering to the untrained glance of the mere male.
Warden’s recollection, vivid enough now, painted a
dark&ndash;skinned, high&ndash;colored girl of nineteen, with expressive
features, a mop of black hair, and a pair of
brilliant eyes that alternated between tints of deepest
brown and purple.</p>

<p>The eyes remained, though their archness was subdued,
but, for the rest, he saw a neck and forehead of
marvelous whiteness, a face of repose, cheeks and ears
of delicate pink, and a waved and plaited mass of hair
of the hue known as Titian red. He found himself
comparing her with Evelyn Dane, whose briar&ndash;rose
coloring shone through clusters of delightful little
freckles, and, somehow, the contrast was displeasing.</p>

<p>The conventional smile of small talk must have
yielded to the strain, because Rosamund Laing noticed
his changed expression.</p>

<p>“Dear me, what have I said now?” she asked.
They were seated at table, at the end of a pleasant
meal, and the talk had wandered from recent doings
to a long&ndash;forgotten point to point steeple&ndash;chase won by
Warden on a horse which Rosamund herself had
nominated.</p>

<p>He recovered his wandering wits instantly.</p>

<p>“It is not anything that you have said, Mrs. Laing,
but my own thoughts that are worrying me,” he said.
“I have been trying to dodge the unpleasant knowledge
that I must gather up my traps and fly to Waterloo.
Lady Hilbury knows that I was <i>en route</i> to the Solent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
when I called&mdash;and&mdash;if I hesitated&mdash;which is unbelievable&mdash;she
prevailed on me to stay by the overwhelming
argument that you would appear forthwith.”</p>

<p>It was the simplest of compliments, but it sufficed.
Rosamund imperilled her fine complexion by blushing
again deeply.</p>

<p>“I was indulging in the vain hope that we might
see you often, now that we are all in England,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Captain Warden has still six months’ furlough at
his disposal,” put in Lady Hilbury. “He is leaving
town on business at the moment, but I shall take care
he returns at the earliest date.”</p>

<p>He stood for a moment in a strong light when he
was to say good&ndash;by. Mrs. Laing noticed the scar on
his forehead.</p>

<p>“Have you had an accident?” she asked, with a note
of caressing tenderness in her voice.</p>

<p>“Nothing to speak of. A slight knock on the head
while swimming in the Solent&mdash;that is all.”</p>

<p>The door had scarce closed on him when Rosamund
turned to her friend. She spoke slowly, but Lady
Hilbury saw that the knuckles of a white hand holding
the back of a chair reddened under the force of the
grip.</p>

<p>“I dared not asked him,” came the steady words,
“but&mdash;perhaps you can tell me&mdash;is he unmarried?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And free?”</p>

<p>“My dear, I think so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>The younger woman let go the chair. Her hands
flew to her face to hide the tears that started forth
unchecked.</p>

<p>“Ah, dear Heaven,” she murmured, “if only I
could be sure!”</p>

<p>That evening, while the incense of tobacco rose from
the deck of the <i>Nancy</i>, Warden learned from Peter the
history of the hours immediately succeeding his departure
from Cowes.</p>

<p>It was unutterably annoying to hear that Figuero
had seen him in Evelyn Dane’s company, and he
deduced a Machiavellian plot from the visit subsequently
paid by the Portuguese to the <i>Sans Souci</i>.
The journey to Milford indirectly suggested by the
Under Secretary’s inquiry anent the appearance of the
yacht now became a fixed purpose from which nothing
would divert him. It seemed to be impossible that
Mr. Baumgartner could fail to recognize the girl’s
description, since comparison with Rosamund Laing
had shown him that Evelyn was by far the most beautiful
creature in England! He was sure that her life
would be made miserable by suspicion, if, indeed, she
had not already received a curt notification that her
services were not required.</p>

<p>Peter’s afternoon with the negroes was evidently
Gargantuan in its chief occupation&mdash;the consumption
of ardent spirits.</p>

<p>“I never did see any crowd ‘oo could shift liquor like
them,” mused the skipper of the <i>Nancy</i>. “It was
‘Dash me one bottole, Peter,’ every five minutes if I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
run to it. I stood ‘em three, just in your interests,
captain, an’ then I turned a pocket inside out, sayin’
‘No more ‘oof, savvy?’ They savvied right enough.
Out goes one chap they called Wanger&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that one of those three men
was named M’Wanga?” broke in Warden, and in the
darkness Peter could not see the blank amazement on
his employer’s face.</p>

<p>“That’s it, sir&mdash;funny sort o’ click they gev’ in
front of it. Sink me, but you do it a treat! Well, ‘is
nibs comes back with two bottles, an’ we finished the
lot afore I began to wonder if I was quite sartin which
of my legs was the wooden one. But, bless yer ‘eart,
there’s no ‘arm in them three niggers. I could live
among ‘em twenty year an’ never ‘ave a wrong word
wi’ one of em.</p>

<p>“Could you gather any inkling of their business
from their talk?”</p>

<p>Peter tamped some half&ndash;burned tobacco into the
bowl of his pipe with the head of a nail before replying.</p>

<p>“There was just one thing that struck me as a bit
pecooliar, sir,” he said, after a meditative pause. “A
joker ‘oo tole me ‘is name was Pana seems to be sort
o’ friendly with a serving&ndash;maid in the <i>Lord Nelson</i>.
She brought in the bottles I ordered, an’ each time
Pana tried to catch ‘old of ‘er. The third time he
grabbed her for fair, an’ sez: ‘You lib for Benin
country w’en I king?’ At that one of ‘is pals jabbered
some double Dutch, an’ they all looked ‘ard at me,
but I was gazin’ into the bottom of a glass at the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
an’ they thought I wasn’t listenin’. It never occurred
to ‘em that I don’t swaller with me ears.”</p>

<p>“Were you present when Figuero returned?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, an’ a nasty cur he can be w’en he likes.
He called ‘em all the different sorts o’ drunken swine
he could think of, an’ tole me I was wuss, to go leadin’
pore ignorant blacks astray. My godfather! Five
bottles of Ole Tom among three of ‘em, an’ me, ‘oo
‘ates the smell o’ gin, tryin’ to doctor my poison wi’
water! If you’ll believe me, sir, at supper&ndash;time I
couldn’t bring myself to touch the nicest bit o’ steak
that ever sizzled on the <i>Nancy</i>’s grid.”</p>

<p>“When did the <i>Sans Souci</i> sail?”</p>

<p>“Just before I sent you that telegram, sir. Chris
saw the niggers an’ the Portygee off by train, an’ kem
straight back to the dinghy. We pulled away to the
cutter, an’ sighted the yacht steamin’ west, so I ‘bout
ship an’ landed Chris near the post&ndash;orfis. The butcher
‘oo supplied their meat tole me this mornin’ that he
was to send his bill to Plymouth.”</p>

<p>Warden, who was wont to take pride in his ability
to be absolutely lazy when on a holiday, suddenly
stood up.</p>

<p>“With this breeze we ought to make Plymouth by
to&ndash;morrow morning?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Are you in earnest, guv’nor?” demanded the
astonished Peter.</p>

<p>“Fully. Bring the cutter past the Needles, and as
soon as St. Abb’s Head&ndash;light is a&ndash;beam you can turn
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Evans realized that his master meant what he said.
Chris, who was in bed and sound asleep, awoke next
morning to find the <i>Nancy</i> abreast of Star Point.
They reached Plymouth in a failing wind about midday,
but Warden’s impatient glance searched the
magnificent harbor in vain for the trim outlines of the
<i>Sans Souci</i>. As the cutter drew near the inner port
both he and Peter knew that they had come on a wild&ndash;goose
chase, no matter how assured the Cowes butcher
might be of his account being paid.</p>

<p>It was a gloriously fine day, but Warden’s impatience
brooked no interference with his plans. It even seemed
to him that the elements had conspired with his personal
ill luck to bring him into this land&ndash;locked estuary
and bottle him up there for a week. Strive as best he
might, he could not shake off the impression that he
ought to be acting, and not dawdling about the south
coast in this aimless fashion. He was quite certain
that a dead calm had overtaken him, and, with this
irritating because unfounded belief, came a curious
suggestion of calamity in store for the <i>Nancy</i> if he
tried to weather the Land’s End <i>en route</i> to Milford
Haven.</p>

<p>“Go to Africa!” whispered some mysterious counselor
in words that were audible to an unknown sense.
“Go where you are wanted. Lady Hilbury told you
that a great opportunity had presented itself. Seize it!
Delay will be fatal!”</p>

<p>Peter, watching the young officer furtively as he
trimmed the cutter to her anchorage, was much perturbed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Though a true sailorman, he seldom swore,
for his religious connections were deep and sincere,
but he did use anathemas now.</p>

<p>“I wish that d&mdash;d Turk’s Head ‘ad rotted in the
sea afore ever it kem aboard this craft,” he muttered.
“There’s bin nothin’ but fuss an’ worry every hour
since that bonny lass set her eyes on it. Onless I’m
vastly mistaken it’ll bust up the cruise, an’ here was
Chris an’ me fixed up to the nines for the nex’ three
months. It’s too bad, that it is”&mdash;and the rest of
his remarks became unfit for publication.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to learn how far Peter would
have fallen from grace if he were told that the calabash
was even then reposing in a portmanteau, by the
side of Warden’s bunk. Happily, he was spared the
knowledge. It would come in good time, but was withheld
for the present.</p>

<p>Warden, restless as a caged lion, did not, as was his
habit, bring a folding&ndash;chair to the shady side of the
mainsail and lose himself in the pages of a book. A
purpose in life of some sort became almost an obsession.
Fixing on the <i>Sans Souci’s</i> known objective at the
extreme southwestern corner of Wales on the following
Wednesday, he suddenly hit upon the idea of
walking across Dartmoor and taking a steamer from
Ilfracombe to Swansea. Once committed to a definite
itinerary of that nature there would be no turning
back. He counted on being able to accomplish the
first stage of the journey easily in three days, which
would bring him to Ilfracombe on the Tuesday. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
only question that remained was the uncertainty of the
steamship service, and a telegram to the shipping
agents would determine that point in an hour or
less.</p>

<p>So Peter brought him ashore in the dinghy, and the
message was despatched, and Warden went for a stroll
on the Hoe, of which pleasant promenade he had
hardly traversed a hundred yards when he saw Evelyn
Dane seated there, deeply absorbed in a magazine.
A bound of his heart carried conviction to his incredulous
brain. Though the girl’s face was bent and almost
hidden by her hat, she offered precisely the same harmonious
picture that had so won his admiration when
she sat opposite to him in the dinghy on that memorable
afternoon that now seemed so remote in the annals
of his life.</p>

<p>A few steps nearer, and he could no longer refuse to
believe his eyes. He recalled the exact patterns of a
brooch, a marquise ring, an ornament in her hat.
Seating himself, with a rapid movement, quite close
to her, he said softly:</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“More, much more, the heart may feel<br />
Than the pen may write or the lip reveal.”</p>

<p class="p1">Evelyn turned with a startled cry. She was conscious
that some one had elected to share her bench;
at the first sound of Warden’s voice she was ready to
spring up and walk away, without looking at him.
Her bright face crimsoned with delight when she
grasped the wonderful fact that he was actually at her
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>She closed the magazine with a bang, and held out
her hand.</p>

<p>“This is indeed a surprise,” she cried. “How in
the world did you know I was here?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know,” he said, clasping her fingers
firmly. “At least, that cannot be true. My ordinary
eat&ndash;three&ndash;meals&ndash;a&ndash;day, keep&ndash;away&ndash;from&ndash;the&ndash;fire&ndash;and&ndash;you
won’t&ndash;get&ndash;burned wits informed me that you were in
far&ndash;off Oxfordshire, but some kindly monitor from
within, unseen, unheard, yet most worthy of credence,
led me here, to your side&mdash;may I say&mdash;to your very
feet.”</p>

<p>Laughing and blushing, and vainly endeavoring to
extricate her hand from his grasp&mdash;because truly she
began to fear that he was drawing her towards him&mdash;her
first uncontrolled action was to glance around and
discover if any passers&ndash;by were gazing at them. Instantly
she knew she had made a mistake, and the
imprisoned hand was snatched away emphatically.
If anything, this only added to her confusion, for it
bore silent testimony to her knowledge of his loverlike
attitude. But she gallantly essayed to retrieve
lost ground.</p>

<p>“I was not an hour at home,” she explained volubly,
“before Mrs. Baumgartner telegraphed and afterward
wrote an entire change of arrangements. I am not
going to Milford Haven. Miss Beryl Baumgartner
came with some friends to a little place down the coast
there, a place called Salcombe, I think, and the <i>Sans
Souci</i> arrived there yesterday. They all come on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Plymouth this evening, and they wish me to be ready
to go on board about nine o’clock, when we sail for
Oban, only stopping twice on the way to coal.”</p>

<p>“Marvelous!” cried Warden. “You reel off amazing
statements with the self&ndash;possession of a young lady
reciting a Browning poem. No, I shall not explain
what I mean&mdash;not yet, at any rate. The glorious
fact prevails that you are free till nine.”</p>

<p>“Free!” she repeated, not that she was at a loss to
understand him, but rather to gain time to collect her
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Absurd, of course. I mean bound&mdash;absolutely
bound to me for a superb vista of&mdash;let me see&mdash;lunch&mdash;long
drive in country&mdash;tea&mdash;more driving&mdash;dinner.&mdash;Ah!
let us not look beyond the dinner.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But me no buts. I shall butt myself violently
against any male person who dares to lay prior claim
to you, while, should the claimant be a lady, I shall
butter her till she relents.”</p>

<p>“Still&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I suppose I must listen,” he complained. “Well,
what is the obstacle?”</p>

<p>She hesitated an instant. Then, abandoning pretense&mdash;for
she, like Warden had lived through many
hours of self&ndash;scrutiny since they parted at Portsmouth&mdash;she
laughed unconcernedly.</p>

<p>“There is none that I know of,” she admitted. “I
had never seen Plymouth, so I traveled here yesterday
evening. My belongings are in the big hotel there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
I am a mere excursionist, out for the day. And now
that I have yielded all along the line, I demand my
woman’s rights. My presence here is readily explained.
What of yours?”</p>

<p>He hailed a passing carriage and directed the man
to take them to the hotel.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I can really clear matters up to your
satisfaction unless you permit me to call you Evelyn,”
he said, daringly irrelevant.</p>

<p>Midsummer madness is infectious&mdash;under certain
conditions.</p>

<p>“That is odd,” she cried, yet there was but feeble
protest in her voice.</p>

<p>“To make things even you must call me Arthur.”</p>

<p>“How utterly absurd!”</p>

<p>“That is not my fault. The name was given me.
I yelled defiance, but I had to have it, like the measles.”</p>

<p>“You know very well&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“’Pon my honor, Evelyn, the greatest of your many
charms is your prompt sympathy. In those few words
you have reconciled me to my lot.”</p>

<p>“I think Arthur is rather a nice name,” she sighed
contentedly. After all, it was best to humor him, and
he was the first man who had ever won her confidence.</p>

<p>“I ask for more than pity,” he said. “Nevertheless,
if I would gain credence I must propound a plain tale.
List, then, while I unfold marvels.”</p>

<p>He was a good talker, and he kept her amused and
interested, at times somewhat thrilled, by the recital
of his doings in London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>They were in a carriage speeding out into the lovely
country westward of Plymouth when he told her the
strange history of Domenico Garcia. She shivered a
little at the gruesome memory of the “parchment”
which she had examined so intently, but she did not
interrupt, save for an occasional question, until he
reached that part of his narrative which ended in the
determination of the previous night to sail to Plymouth
forthwith.</p>

<p>“It is all very strange and mysterious,” she said at
last. “You were coming to Milford Haven, I gather?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And were it not for the impulse that brought me
here you would now be on your way over Dartmoor?”</p>

<p>“That was my fixed intention.”</p>

<p>“Was it so very important that you should know all
about the <i>Sans Souci</i>?”</p>

<p>“I would have said so to the Under Secretary.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. Warden deliberately passed
the opening given by her words. In broad daylight,
and whirling rapidly through a village, it behooved
him to be circumspect. Between dinner and nine
o’clock he would contrive other opportunities.</p>

<p>“Lady Hilbury must be very nice,” she went on,
after a brief silence.</p>

<p>“You will like her immensely when you know her,”
he could not help saying, at the same time thanking
his stars that he had made no mention of Rosamund
Laing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a further pause. Evelyn fancied that her
voice was well under control when she asked:</p>

<p>“Have you decided to carry out poor Domenico
Garcia’s last request?”</p>

<p>“Before answering, will you tell me what you would
do in my place?”</p>

<p>“I would go to Rabat, if it were in my power, and
there were no undue risk in the undertaking. I don’t
think I would be happy if I had not made the effort.
Yet, Rabat is a long way from England. Would you
be absent many weeks? Perhaps such a journey
would spoil your leave. And then&mdash;things may
happen in West Africa. You may be needed there.”</p>

<p>“Rabat is a half&ndash;way house to Oku, Evelyn,” he
said. “I am going, of course, for two reasons. In
the first instance, I want to set Garcia’s soul at rest
about those masses which, it seems to me, can only be
done by obeying the letter of his instructions. And,
secondly, I mean to secure that ruby.”</p>

<p>This time she passed no comment.</p>

<p>He caught her arm and bent closer.</p>

<p>“If I bring it to you in Madeira you will not refuse
to accept it?” he said.</p>

<p>“Now you are talking nonsense,” she replied, turning
and looking at him bravely, with steadfast scrutiny.</p>

<p>“No. There would be a condition, of course.
With the ruby you must take the giver.”</p>

<p>“Are you asking me to marry you?” she almost
whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“After knowing me a few idle hours of three days?”</p>

<p>“I was exactly the same mind the first time I met
you. I see no valid reason why I should change a well&ndash;balanced
opinion during the next thirty or forty years.”</p>

<p>He felt her arm trembling in his clasp, and a suspicious
moisture glistened in her fine eyes.</p>

<p>“I think, somehow, I know you well enough to believe
that you are in earnest,” she faltered. “But let
us forget now that you have said those words. Come
to me later&mdash;when your work is done&mdash;and if you
care to repeat them&mdash;I shall&mdash;try to answer&mdash;as
you would wish.”</p>

<p>And then, for a few hours, they lived in the Paradise
that can be entered only by lovers.</p>

<p>Not that there were tender passages between them&mdash;squeezings,
and pressings and the many phrases of
silent languages that mean “I love you.” Neither
was formed of the malleable clay that permits such
sudden change of habit. Each dwelt rather in a
dream&ndash;land&mdash;the man hoping it could be true that
this all&ndash;pleasing woman could find it possible to surrender
herself to him utterly&mdash;the woman becoming
more alive each moment to the astounding consciousness
that she loved and was beloved.</p>

<p>Their happiness seemed to be so fantastically complete
that they made no plans for the future. They
were wilfully blind to the shoals and cross currents
that must inevitably affect the smooth progress of that
life voyage they would make together. Rather, when
they talked, did they seek to discover more of the past,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of their common tastes, of their friends, of the “little
histories” of youth. Thus did they weld the first
slender links of sweet intimacy&mdash;those links that are
stronger than fetters of steel in after years&mdash;and the
hours flew on golden wings.</p>

<p>Once only did Warden hold Evelyn in his arms&mdash;in
a farewell embrace ere she left him to join the yacht.
And, when that ecstatic moment had passed, and the
boat which held his new&ndash;found mate was vanishing into
the gloom, he awoke to the knowledge that he had much
to accomplish before he might ask her to be his bride.</p>

<p>But he thrust aside gray thought for that night of
bliss. He almost sang aloud as he walked to the quay
where Peter was waiting, after receiving a brief message
earlier in the day. He was greeted cheerily.</p>

<p>“I’m main glad to see you again, sir,” said the skipper
of the <i>Nancy</i>. “Somehows, I had a notion this
mornin’ that we was goin’ to lose you for good an’ all.”</p>

<p>Then Warden remembered the inquiry he had sent
to Ilfracombe, and the reply that was surely waiting
for him at the post&ndash;office, and he laughed with a quiet
joyousness that was good to hear.</p>

<p>“Peter,” he said, “you’re a first&ndash;class pilot, but
neither you nor any other man can look far into the
future, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” came the prompt answer, “that’s a sea
without charts or soundin’s an’ full of everlastin’ fog.
But sometimes one can do a bit o’ guessin’, an’ that’s
wot I’ve bin doin’ since Chris tole me he saw you an’
the young leddy a&ndash;drivin’ in a keb!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pc1">TWO WOMEN</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. Isidore David Baumgartner was in a state of
high good humor. After wasting many hundreds of
cartridges he had actually shot a driven grouse. True,
the method of slaughter amounted almost to a crime.
Traveling fast and low before the wind, the doomed
bird flew straight toward the butts. Baumgartner
closed his eyes, fired both barrels&mdash;the first intentionally,
the second from sheer nervousness&mdash;and a
cloud of feathers, out of which fell all that was left of
legs, wings, and body, showed how a gallant moorcock
had met his fate.</p>

<p>“There’s a clean hit for you, Sandy,” cried the little
man delightedly. “It’s all knack. I knew I could do
it, once I got the hang of it.”</p>

<p>“Man, but ye stoppit him,” replied Sandy, who
doled out encouragement with a sour grin. The
shattered carcass lay in full view on a tuft of heather.
Two ounces of shot had riddled it at a distance of ten
feet.</p>

<p>“I suppose the second barrel was hardly necessary,”
said Baumgartner, more critically.</p>

<p>“It’s best to mak’ sure,” said the sardonic gillie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
“but now ye’ve got yer ‘ee in, as the sayin’ is, mebbe
ye’ll be droppin’ ithers, Mr. Baumgartner.”</p>

<p>He held forth the spare gun as a hint. Grouse were
plentiful at Lochmerig, and three other men in the line
of shelters were busy. Baumgartner forthwith excelled
himself. Just as a novice at Monte Carlo may
achieve several winning coups in succession, so did
fortune favor one whom nature had not designed as a
sportsman. He shot with blind confidence, and brought
down half a dozen birds while they came sailing over
the crest of the hill before a strong breeze that brought
them to close range. That he rendered them for the
most part uneatable did not trouble him in the least.
Sport was merely slaying to him; his only trophies
previously were some tame pigeons secured for practice.</p>

<p>So Baumgartner was well content. As he trudged
down the brae to Lochmerig Lodge, discoursing
learnedly to his companions anent the “stopping”
qualities of his eighty&ndash;guinea pair of guns, his eyes
roved over the beauties of loch and glen, and the day&ndash;dream
that it would be well to pass the remainder of
his days in this quiet haven cast its spell on his soul.
Rich as he was, he owned no home except a garish
mansion in New York. His career had been meteoric,
full of lurid energy. Beginning with the lust of money,
he had followed the beaten track of his order, and
became obsessed with the lust of power. Yet his
ambition needed spurring. Already the tremendous
issues involved in the project which procured him the
condescending patronage of an emperor were revealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
their dangers. Here, in Scotland, surrounded by subservient
friends and well&ndash;trained servants, he longed
for rest. Lairdship was proving a subtle rival to West
African adventure.</p>

<p>Moreover, he was married, and Mrs. Baumgartner
was endowed with a will of her own and a tongue to
bear witness thereto. She was learning to appreciate
the easy tolerance of English society, which proved
itself far more accessible than the Four Hundred of
New York. Men and women of recognized social
rank and pleasant manners were quite willing to shoot
over the Lochmerig moors, play bridge in the Lodge,
cruise on the <i>Sans Souci</i>, and generally live and amuse
themselves at the millionaire’s expense. Mrs. Baumgartner
was shrewd enough to see that the gain of a
big slice of British territory in West Africa would offer
poor compensation for the loss of the new career which
was opening up an alluring vista to her dazzled gaze.
For once, therefore, discord threatened in the household.
In her daughter, too, she found a powerful ally.
A month of close companionship with Evelyn Dane
had completely changed the life&ndash;theories of a spoiled
and affected girl of eighteen. Too young as yet to be
jealous of Evelyn’s greater attractions, Beryl Baumgartner
was alert enough to see that vulgar pertness
was ludicrously inadequate as a means of winning
male regard. Luckily, she became enthusiastically
attached to Evelyn from the first hour. The wonderful
faculty of hero&ndash;worship had survived the precocity of
a too&ndash;indulgent rearing. It was stronger now than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
mere counsel. Beryl began to copy her new friend,
and at once she began to improve.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, a very dark cloud that lowered
over the Baumgartner sky when a family coach which
brought visitors from the ten miles distant railway
deposited at the hospitable door of Lochmerig Lodge,
at one and the same moment, Mrs. Laing, Miguel
Figuero, and Count von Rippenbach. As it happened,
the three already knew each other slightly.
They had met in Madeira during the previous winter.
Figuero then acted as bear&ndash;leader to the count before
he started on the hunting trip in the Tuburi hinterland
which had come to the Under Secretary’s knowledge.</p>

<p>It was a surprise to both men when they encountered
Mrs. Laing at Perth Junction. They passed several
interesting hours in her company, and von Rippenbach,
who spoke English better than Figuero, was a
skilled cross&ndash;examiner. Thus, he soon hit upon a
plausible explanation of the lady’s appearance in
Inverness&ndash;shire. She was one of Mrs. Baumgartner’s
social links with England. On his part, as a “distinguished
foreigner,” he would be acceptable in a
higher circle than that occupied by his host, but, when
it came to Figuero, Mrs. Laing was puzzled&mdash;indeed,
somewhat amused.</p>

<p>The man’s record was no secret. Tolerant Madeira
did not ask how he had risen to seeming affluence.
It helped him to spend his money, and was graciously
blind to the darker pages of his history&mdash;nevertheless,
those pages were an open book to local gossips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Figuero, a shrewd and level&ndash;headed scoundrel, was
the most taken aback of the trio at this unlooked&ndash;for
meeting. He was aware of the love passages between
Warden and Rosamund Laing; he feared Warden;
and here was the woman whom Warden had once
loved crossing his path at an awkward hour.</p>

<p>The situation might have provided harmless interest
for a number of unimportant people at Lochmerig if
Figuero had not recognized Evelyn Dane the instant
he set eyes on her. Straightway the tiny rills of intrigue
and suspicion flowing through the adventurer’s
brain united into a torrent.</p>

<p>Seizing the first opportunity that presented itself, he
drew Baumgartner into an unoccupied room, and
closed and locked the door. Before the surprised
millionaire could utter a word of protest, the West
African fire&ndash;brand began to question him in his own
tongue, since Baumgartner, despite his Teutonic label
and semblance, had a Portuguese mother.</p>

<p>“Why did you fail to recognize the girl I described
to you in Cowes?” he demanded fiercely. “Malediction!
Are you mad, that you would risk our enterprise
in this fashion?”</p>

<p>“You must neither address me in that manner nor
talk in riddles,” growled Baumgartner. “What girl?
How am I to know one among the ten thousand girls
of a regatta week?”</p>

<p>“Riddles! It is you who are the conundrum,
senhor. I tell you that this Englishman, Captain
Warden, a Deputy Commissioner in Nigeria, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
man we have most to fear, yet you permit one who is
probably his fiancée, and surely in league with him, to
live in your house and spy on the actions of yourself and
your friends. What will Count von Rippenbach think
when I tell him? What will the Emperor say, after
all the precautions we took that none should know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence!” roared Baumgartner, who could hold his
own in matters that demanded clear thinking and
careful guidance. “You are too ready with some
names, Senhor Figuero, yet too sparing of others that
may explain your folly. Of whom are you speaking?”</p>

<p>“Of the young Englishwoman I have just met, of
course. I am not good at catching these strange
words, but I mean the good&ndash;looking one, the tall slim
girl in white muslin, she with brown hair and Madonna
eyes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Miss Dane?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;that is she. I remember now.”</p>

<p>“My daughter’s companion! Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“It is true, I tell you. Am I likely to forget a face&mdash;and
such a face! Did I not describe her dress?
She must have left your yacht just before Warden met
her. And they are lovers. How can I be mistaken?
They went away from Cowes in the same train. I told
you her destination. What was it? I have it written
here,” and he hurriedly turned over the leaves of a
note&ndash;book.</p>

<p>Baumgartner was undoubtedly impressed. Figuero’s
earnestness was not to be gainsaid, and he had
an unpleasant belief, now he came to recall the incidents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of a busy day, that Evelyn Dane was dressed
exactly as Warden’s unknown acquaintance was pictured.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Portuguese found the memorandum
he sought.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” he snapped, all a&ndash;quiver with the doubts
that threatened the destruction of his pet scheme of
vengeance on the British power which had stopped the
supply of slaves to the Sultan of Bogota. “Langton
in Oxfordshire&mdash;that is the place. The railway
official spelt it for me. A boatman told me he knew
the girl, and gave me some outlandish name as being
hers. Now I see he was fooling me. What was his
motive? Was he also an emissary of Warden’s? Let
me assure you, senhor, this thing begins to look
ugly.”</p>

<p>Baumgartner’s heavy jowl lost some of the ruddy
hue of the moors. Count von Rippenbach had been
ready enough to apply the screw when his quondam
confederate showed a degree of hesitancy in falling in
with the proposal he came from London to make, and
this latest complication would strengthen von Rippenbach’s
hands beyond resistance. Already the lairdship
of Lochmerig was becoming visionary, and the far&ndash;off
hills of interior Africa grew more substantial in their
dim outlines.</p>

<p>But the millionaire, though he might toady to a
Scottish gillie for a crumb of recognition as a marksman,
had not attained his present position by displaying
weakness in face of a crisis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“I believe you are the victim of a delusion,” he said,
with some show of dignity, “but, even if you are right,
we gain nothing by yielding to panic. What if Miss
Dane is, as you say, Warden’s <i>belle amie</i>? Why should
that be harmful? Does it not explain his visit to
Cowes? Indeed, once we are convinced that they
know each other, we can turn the circumstance to our
own purpose. I am far from crediting an insignificant
official of the Niger Company with the importance you
seem to attach to him, but, granted he is a hostile
influence to be feared, why not stalk him through an
unsuspecting agent?”</p>

<p>“You don’t rate him high enough,” muttered Figuero.
“He can sway those stupid niggers like no
other man in Nigeria. He talks Arabic, and Hausa,
and krooboy palaver as well as I do. He broke the
Oku ju&ndash;ju when it was worth a thousand lives to touch
a stick or a feather. If Warden gets wind of our
project before we are ready, we will fail, and you
realize what that means to all of us.”</p>

<p>A dinner gong came to Baumgartner’s aid. He
wished to avoid any discussion on the last point raised
by the Portuguese. It bristled with thorns. Von
Rippenbach revealed some of its cactus&ndash;like properties
earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>“You and I and the Count will go into other matters
fully to&ndash;morrow,” he said. “As for Miss Dane, I
shall clear up that difficulty without delay. Act as
though you had never seen her before, and keep your
ears open during dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>So it came to pass that Evelyn, who was mightily
astonished and perplexed by the arrival of the two
men concerning whom Warden had told her so much,
was still more bewildered when Mr. Baumgartner
availed himself of a lull in the conversation at the
dinner&ndash;table to say casually:</p>

<p>“By the way, Miss Dane, is Langton, in Oxfordshire,
near your people’s place?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, wondering what the question
signified.</p>

<p>“I suppose, then, you passed through it on your
way home after quitting the <i>Sans Souci</i> at Cowes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Langton is our station.”</p>

<p>“Ah! What a small world it is! A friend of mine,
Mr. James G. Hertz, of Boston, is staying there now.
I suppose you did not chance to meet him?”</p>

<p>“No. Our village is three miles away, and that is a
long distance in the country.”</p>

<p>And, in truth, Mr. James G. Hertz, of Boston, who
was buried in Boston, could tell of yet more impassable
gulfs.</p>

<p>Rosamund Laing was sitting next to Figuero. She
noticed the eager attention with which he followed
this trivial bit of talk, though his limited knowledge
of English rendered most of the lively chatter at the
table unintelligible.</p>

<p>“Were you in Cowes during the regatta week,
Senhor Figuero?” she asked.</p>

<p>It was a reasonable deduction from his presence at
Lochmerig, but she little guessed the devilish purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
engendered in that alert brain by her aimless inquiry.
The Portuguese felt that he was at a disadvantage
among the gay throng gathered under Baumgartner’s
roof. His nimble wits were dulled by the barrier of
language. It put him outside the pale. Things might
be occurring which he ought to know, but which were
hidden from him owing to this drawback. In the
beautiful woman by his side he might find an excellent
go&ndash;between if only he could command her interest.
Was that old flame quite quenched in her heart, he
mused? She had married a rich man, but had she
forgotten&mdash;did any woman ever forget&mdash;her first
love? He thought not. At any rate, here was an
opening provided by the gods.</p>

<p>“I lib for Cowes one&ndash;time, senora,” he murmured,
“an’ I see somet’ing dere dat I tell you if you not
vexed.”</p>

<p>“Why should I be vexed?” she said, smiling at the
odd expressions, though she was quite conversant with
the <i>lingua franca</i> of the coast.</p>

<p>“You ‘member dem Captain Warden?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p>“An’ you keep secret dem t’ing I tell you?”</p>

<p>“Where Captain Warden’s affairs are concerned, I
shall certainly not discuss him or them.”</p>

<p>Figuero paid no heed to the intentional snub.</p>

<p>“You understan’ better w’en I tole you dem secret.
You promise not speak ‘im any one?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>“He fit for marry dem Mees Dane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be idiotic.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Laing could not help it. She was so startled
that she raised her voice, and more than one of her
neighbors wondered what the sallow&ndash;faced stranger
had said that evoked the outburst. Figuero looked
annoyed. He was not prepared for such vehement
repudiation of his news. Fortunately, the Honorable
Billy Thring was giving a realistic account of his
failure to secure an heiress during a recent wife&ndash;hunting
tour in America&mdash;he tried lots of ‘em, he explained,
but they all said he must kill off at least one brother
and two healthy nephews before they would risk
marryin’ a prize dude like him&mdash;so Rosamund’s
emphatic cry passed almost unheeded amidst the
laughter evoked by Thring’s exploits.</p>

<p>“You fit for chop,” muttered the Portuguese sarcastically.
“You fit for fool palaver. You plenty&ndash;much
silly woman.”</p>

<p>“But what you say cannot be true,” she half whispered,
and the man’s astute senses warned him that it
was dread, not contempt, that drew the protest from
her lips.</p>

<p>“I fit for tell you Warden make wife palaver wid
dem girl at Cowes. If you no b’lieve me, make sof’
mouf an’ ax Mees Dane.”</p>

<p>Then the woman remembered Warden’s anxiety to
return to the Isle of Wight. He had not written to
her or to Lady Hilbury during the past month, and
this fact, trivial as a pin&ndash;prick before, now became a
rankling wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“You keep dem secret?” went on Figuero, watching
her closely.</p>

<p>“Why did you tell me?” she retorted.</p>

<p>“Coss I no want Warden marry dem girl. Savvy?”</p>

<p>“Do you want to marry her yourself?” she asked,
with a bitterness that showed how deeply she was hurt.</p>

<p>He grinned, and wetted his thin lips with his tongue.</p>

<p>“You t’ink I tired goin’ by lone?” he said.</p>

<p>“What is your motive? Why do you choose me as a
confidant?”</p>

<p>Figuero suddenly became dense.</p>

<p>“I tell you leetle bit news,” he said. “Dat is English
custom. W’en we chop one&ndash;time palaver set.
But you no say Figuero tole you dem t’ing.”</p>

<p>Rosamund did not reply. She endeavored to eat,
and entered into conversation with a man near her.
The Honorable Billy was ending his story.</p>

<p>“So I am still eligible,” he was saying. “I went to
America full of hot air, and came back with cold feet.
But I learned the language&mdash;eh, what?”</p>

<p>That night, in the drawing&ndash;room, Mrs. Laing carried
out the opening move in a campaign she had mapped
out for herself. If Figuero’s story were true, she
would smite and spare not. If it were untrue, Evelyn
would be the first to deny it, and Rosamund trusted
to her own intuition to discover how far such denial
might be credited.</p>

<p>A man who was talking to Evelyn was summoned to
a bridge table, and Rosamund took his place unobtrusively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you really were on board the Sans Souci at
Cowes, Miss Dane?” she began, with a friendly smile.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Evelyn, at a loss to determine why her
brief sojourn in the Solent should attract such widespread
attention.</p>

<p>“And you met Captain Warden there?”</p>

<p>The attack was so direct and unexpected that the
younger woman blushed and flinched from it. Still,
she was not to be drawn into admissions like a frightened
child.</p>

<p>“I met several people on the island,” she said.
“Cowes is a crowded place during regatta week.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now,” purred the smiling Rosamund,
“one does not forget a man of Arthur Warden’s type
so readily&mdash;and after a violent flirtation, too! You
see, I know all about it. Little birds whisper these
things. Arthur did not tell me when he came to see
me in town. Of course, he wouldn’t, but there are
always kind&ndash;hearted people willing enough to gossip
if they think they are annoying one.”</p>

<p>There was sufficient innuendo in this brief speech
to justify Mrs. Laing’s worst estimate of scandal&ndash;mongers.
Not one barbed shaft missed its mark. If
words could wound, then Evelyn must have succumbed,
but the injuries they inflict are not always visible, and
she kept a stiff upper lip, though her heart raced in
wild tumult.</p>

<p>“The inference is that you are far more interested in
Captain Warden’s visits to Cowes than I or any other
person can pretend to be,” she said slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>She meant the cold&ndash;drawn phrase to hurt, and in
that she succeeded, though her own voice sounded in
her ears as if it had come from afar.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you ought to be told that he and I
are engaged,” said Rosamund, stung to a sudden fury
of lying. “Don’t imagine I bear malice. You are
sweetly pretty, and Arthur is so susceptible! But he
is also rather thoughtless. We were pledged to each
other years ago, but were kept apart by&mdash;by a mother’s
folly. Now I am free, and he came back to me, though
I had to insist that at least a year should elapse between
my husband’s death and the announcement of our
engagement. All our friends know our sad story, and
would forgive some measure of haste, but one has to
consider the larger circle of the public.”</p>

<p>Then, indeed, Evelyn’s blood seemed to chill in her
veins. The room and its occupants swam before her
eyes, and the pain of repression became almost unbearable,
yet she was resolved to carry off the honors
in this duel unless she fainted.</p>

<p>“I gather that you are warning me against Captain
Warden’s thoughtlessness, as you term it?” she said,
compelling each word at the bayonet’s point, as it were.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was not speaking seriously, but we can let
it go at that.”</p>

<p>“And you wish me to understand that you are his
promised wife?”</p>

<p>“There, at least, I am most emphatic,” and Rosamund
laughed, a trifle shrilly, perhaps, for a woman
so well equipped with the armor of self&ndash;conceit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose, then, that the late Mr. Laing has been
dead a year, as I form one of that larger circle whose
favorable opinion you court?”</p>

<p>For an instant Rosamund’s black eyes flashed angrily.
She had expected tears and faltering, not resistance.</p>

<p>“I only meant to do you a good turn, yet on the raw,”
she sneered.</p>

<p>“Pray do not consider me at all. By your own
showing, I have no grievance&mdash;no <i>locus standi</i>, as the
lawyers say&mdash;but, since you have gone out of your
way to give a mere stranger this interesting information,
I wish to be quite sure of the facts. For instance,
let us suppose that I have the honor of Captain
Warden’s acquaintance&mdash;am I at liberty to write
and congratulate him?”</p>

<p>“That would place me in a false position.”</p>

<p>“Ah. Is there nothing to be said for me? You
spoke of a ‘violent flirtation,’ I think. If I may guess
at the meaning of a somewhat crude phrase, it seems
to imply a possible exchange of lovers’ vows, and one
of the parties might be misled&mdash;and suffer.”</p>

<p>“We women are the sinners most frequently.”</p>

<p>“I do not dispute your authority, Mrs. Laing. I
only wish to ascertain exactly what I am free to say to
Captain Warden?”</p>

<p>“Tell him you met me, and that I am well posted
in everything that occurred at Cowes. And, for goodness’
sake, let me see his reply. It will be too killing
to read Arthur’s verbal wrigglings, because he is really
clever, don’t you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>Somehow, despite the steely tension of every nerve,
Evelyn caught an undertone of anxiety in the jesting
words. Her rival was playing a bold game. It might
end in complete disaster, but, once committed to it,
there was no drawing back.</p>

<p>“The proceedings at Cowes were open to all the
world,” Evelyn could not help saying. “Even you,
with your long experience, might fail to detect in them
any trace of the thoughtlessness you deplore.”</p>

<p>“Then you have met him elsewhere?”</p>

<p>Evelyn, conscious of a tactical blunder, colored even
more deeply with annoyance, though again she felt
that her tormentor was not so sure of her ground as
she professed to be. Every woman is a born actress,
and Evelyn precipitated a helpful crisis with histrionic
skill.</p>

<p>“The whole story is yours, not mine, Mrs. Laing,”
she said quietly. “Perhaps, if you apply to your
half&ndash;caste informant, he may fill in further details to
please you.”</p>

<p>At that moment the Honorable Billy Thring intervened.
He was one of those privileged persons who
can say anything to anybody without giving offense,
and he broke into the conversation now with his usual
frank inanity.</p>

<p>“I find I’ve bin lookin’ for a faithful spouse in the
wrong direction, Mrs. Laing,” he chortled. “Barkin’
up the wrong tree, a Chicago girl called it. What a
thorough ass I was to spin that yarn at dinner with
you in the room. Will you be good, an’ forget it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Don’t say I haven’t got an earthly before the flag
falls.”</p>

<p>“What in the world are you talking about?” cried
Rosamund, turning on him with the sourest of society
smiles.</p>

<p>“It sounds like the beginning of a violent flirtation,”
said Evelyn, yielding to the impulse that demanded
some redress for the torture she had endured.</p>

<p>“Right you are, Miss Dane,” said Billy. “By gad,
that clears the course quicker than a line of policemen.
You see, Mrs. Laing, I really must marry somebody
with sufficient means for both of us. I have expensive
tastes, and my noble dad gave me neither a profession
nor an income. So what is a fellow to do?”</p>

<p>“You flatter me,” said Rosamund tartly. “Unfortunately
I have just been telling Miss Dane that I am
<i>hors de concours</i>, as they put it in the Paris exhibitions.”</p>

<p>“That is the French for ‘you never know your luck,’
Mr. Thring,” cried Evelyn, with a well&ndash;assumed laugh.
“Mrs. Laing may change her mind, too, not for the
first time.”</p>

<p>Without giving her adversary a chance to retaliate,
she darted away to join Beryl Baumgartner, and
soon seized an opportunity to retreat to her own room.
Once safely barricaded behind a locked door, she
bowed before the storm. Flinging herself on her knees
by the bedside, she wept as though her heart would
break. It was her first taste of the bitter cup that is
held out to many a girl in her position, and its gall was
not diminished because she still believed that Arthur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Warden loved her. How could she doubt him, when
each passing week brought her a letter couched in the
most endearing terms? Only that morning had she
heard from him at Ostend, whither the <i>Nancy</i> had
flown after making a round of the Norfolk Broads.
He described his chances of speedy promotion once
the threatened disturbance in West Africa had spent
itself, and, oddly enough, reminded her of his intention
to curtail his furlough so as to permit of a visit to Rabat
in a coasting steamer before going to Madeira on his
way to the Protectorate.</p>

<p>Not a word did he say of the Baumgartners, or their
queer acquaintances of the Isle of Wight. It was
tacitly agreed between them that Evelyn should not
play the rôle of spy on her employers, and, indeed,
until that very day there was little to report save the
utmost kindness at their hands.</p>

<p>Why, then, it may be urged, did she weep so unrestrainedly?
and only the virgin heart of a woman who
loves can answer. She feared that Rosamund Laing
was telling the truth when she spoke of a prior engagement.
She knew that Warden had said nothing at
Plymouth of meeting Rosamund in London, and she
was hardly to be blamed for drawing the most sinister
inference from his silence. Did he dread that earlier
entanglement? He was poor, and she was poor; how
could he resist the pleading of one so rich and beautiful
as her rival?</p>

<p>In short, poor Evelyn passed a grievous and needlessly
tortured hour before she endeavored to compose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
herself for sleep, and she was denied the consolation
of knowing that the woman who destroyed her happiness
was pacing another room like a caged tigress,
and striving to devise some means of extricating herself
from the morass into which Figuero’s tidings and
her own rashness had plunged her.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pc1">SHOWING HOW MANY ROADS LEAD THE SAME WAY</p>

<p class="p2">Next day, her mind restored to its customary equipoise,
Evelyn thought she would be acting wisely if she
gave Warden some hint of recent developments. Too
proud to ask for an explicit denial of Rosamund Laing’s
claim, she saw the absurdity of letting affairs drift
until the hoped&ndash;for meeting at Madeira. At first, she
thought of resigning her post as Beryl’s companion, and
returning to Oxfordshire, but she set the notion aside
as unreasonable and unnecessary. Most certainly
Warden should not be condemned unheard. Without
pressing him for a definite statement with regard to
Mrs. Laing, it was a simple matter to put the present
situation before him in such guise that he could not
choose but refer to it. So, after drafting a few sentences,
and weighing them seriously, she incorporated
the following in a letter of general import:</p>

<p>“Yesterday we had three new arrivals whose names
must appeal to you powerfully. First, a Mrs. Rosamund
Laing came here from London, and she lost no
time in telling me, among other things, that she was
aware of our meeting at Cowes. Her informant, I
am sure, was Miguel Figuero, and you will be even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
more astonished to learn that he and Count von Rippenbach
turned up by the same train as Mrs. Laing.
The latter, by the way, said that you called on her at
Lady Hilbury’s when in London. Is that true? There
are some hidden forces in motion at Lochmerig which
I do not understand. Mr. Baumgartner tackled me
openly at dinner with regard to my journey from
Cowes to Oxfordshire. We know from Peter that
Figuero saw us together that morning, and your Portuguese
friend evidently recognized me at once. But
Mr. Baumgartner’s pointed reference to Langton as
my destination was rather puzzling. How does it
strike you? I expect my news will prove rather in
the nature of a thunderbolt, and that is usually a very
striking article. I assure you I am somewhat shaken
myself. Mrs. Laing’s personal attributes remind one
of those galvanic batteries you see at fairs in the country&mdash;the
more you try to endure her magnetic influence,
the greater your collapse.”</p>

<p>Before sealing the envelope, she re&ndash;read Warden’s
latest letter. She even read it aloud, and the straightforward,
honest, loving words assumed a new significance.
Then she turned to her own effusion, and
viewed it critically. To her surprise, she detected a
jarring, somewhat cynical, note in those passages
which she regarded as all&ndash;important. To her judgment,
events in the near future would follow a well&ndash;defined
course. Her lover would say whether or not
he had met Mrs. Laing in London, and give the clearest
reasons for his omission of her name from the subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
recital of his adventures. Evelyn would count
the hours until that reply reached her hands. Perhaps
Mrs. Laing’s curiosity anent Warden’s skill in
“wriggling” would then be sated. She might even
give an exhibition of the wriggler’s art in her own
behalf.</p>

<p>Evelyn refused to admit now that she had ever
yielded to doubt or anxiety. The hysterical outburst
of last night was natural, perhaps, under the circumstances,
but quite nonsensical. Even Warden himself
must be made to believe that Mrs. Laing was only
indulging an exuberant sense of humor in claiming
his fealty. Meaning, therefore, to tone down any
apparent asperity in the paragraph referring to the
three newcomers, she added a few lines beneath her
signature.</p>

<p>“The Men of Oku have not yet appeared. I am
longing to see them. They are really the most picturesque
villains in the piece. I am just going for a
stroll by the side of the loch, and I shall not be a little
bit alarmed if I find a decorated calabash sailing in
with the tide.”</p>

<p>There is nothing new in the fact that the most important
item in a woman’s letter is often contained in
a postscript, but never did the writer of a harmless
and gossipy missive achieve such amazing results as
Evelyn Dane brought to pass by the words she scribbled
hurriedly after the magic letters “P.S.”</p>

<p>For others than Evelyn Dane were taking thought
that morning. Baumgartner, von Rippenbach, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Figuero&mdash;locked in the library, and seated round a
small table drawn well away from the door&mdash;were
settling the final details of a scheme that aimed at
nothing less than a very grave alteration in the political
map of the world, while Rosamund Laing was planning
an enterprise which should have an equally marked
effect in the minor sphere of her own affairs.</p>

<p>Yet the fortunes of these five people gathered at
Lochmerig, and of many millions in other parts of the
earth, were absolutely controlled by one of those
trivial conditions which appear to be so ludicrously
out of proportion with ultimate achievement.</p>

<p>Baumgartner, being a rich man, objected to delay
where his interests were concerned. Refusing to await
the tardy coming of a country postman, he kept a
groom in the village to which the mails were brought
by train, and it was this man’s duty to ride in each
day with the post&ndash;bag for Lochmerig Lodge and return
some hours later with the first out&ndash;going budget. The
house letters were dropped into a box in the entrance
hall, and a notice intimated that the time of clearance
was at noon. To an unscrupulous woman, such an
arrangement offered the means to do ill deeds that
makes ill deeds done. Rosamund, ready to dare anything
now to save herself from contumely, actually set
out to find Evelyn and taunt her into an admission
that she had written to Warden.</p>

<p>“Miss Dane is not in the house, madam,” said the
London footman on duty at the door. “She went out
some time since&mdash;in that direction,” and he pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
toward the glistening firth that brought the North Sea
into the heart of Inverness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laing pouted prettily.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” she sighed. “I do hope she has not
forgotten to write. I shall never find her in time.
<i>Did</i> you happen to notice if she posted a letter?”</p>

<p>The footman sought inspiration by stroking his chin.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” he announced, after a pause. “I’m
almost certain Miss Dane went to the box. Yes, I’m
sure of it.”</p>

<p>Madam was very much obliged, and tipped him
half&ndash;a&ndash;crown, informing him with a most charming
smile that she did not on any account wish Miss Dane
to believe that she was suspected of forgetfulness. It
was then some few minutes after eleven, and this
gracious lady was sympathetic enough to inquire if
the footman did not become very tired of remaining
on duty so many hours in one place.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nothing compared with London, ma’am,”
said he. “Here we have sunshine&mdash;if the weather is
fine&mdash;an’ fresh air all the time. I only came on duty
at nine o’clock, an’ I go off at 11.30 for the first servants’
dinner.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Laing was talking to Billy Thring in the hall
when the postman groom came to clear the letter&ndash;box.
She darted forward with that irresistible smile of hers.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad I happened to be standing here,” she
exclaimed. “I have just remembered that I have
stupidly left out of a letter the very thing I most wanted
to say. It would never have occurred to me if I hadn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
seen you. The letter is addressed to Captain Warden.
May I have it?”</p>

<p>The man was Baumgartner’s servant. He had
never before set eyes on Mrs. Laing, but he knew the
Honorable Billy quite well, so he raised no objection
to this smartly dressed lady’s eager search for her
incomplete letter. Though her hands fumbled somewhat,
she soon picked it out.</p>

<p>“Here it is!” she cried delightedly, “this one&mdash;Captain
Arthur Warden, Poste Restante, Ostend.
Now, that will save me a heap of trouble. It <i>was</i> so
nice of you to come in at the right moment. You have
saved me a lot of trouble.”</p>

<p>The groom grinned as he pocketed half&ndash;a&ndash;crown.
Some ladies were easy pleased, to be sure. Even
Billy Thring, experienced hunter of gilded brides, was
bewildered by Mrs. Laing’s excited manner.</p>

<p>“Seems to me I’ve made a killin’,” he mused when
she gushed herself away. “I s’pose old Baumgartner
can be relied on. He is all there as a rule when he
talks dollars an’ cents, but he’s a perfect rotter every
other way. By gad, I’ll kid him into wearin’ kilts
before the end of the month.”</p>

<p>The notion tickled him. He lit a cigarette and
strolled out through the open door. A glorious sweep
of moorland and forest spread beyond the loch, whose
wavelets lapped the verges of the sloping lawn and
gardens. A little to the left the <i>Sans Souci</i> lay at her
moorings. A steam launch was tied to a neat landing&ndash;stage.
A string of horses and moor ponies returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
from exercise crossed a level pasture at the head of the
loch. The letter&ndash;carrying groom was clattering down
the broad carriage drive toward the distant station,
and a couple of gardeners were cutting and rolling
the green carpet of grass in front of the house.</p>

<p>“He talks of buyin’ this property,” communed the
Honorable Billy, who was thirty&ndash;five and had never
earned a penny in his life. “Can’t be ten years older
than me, though he looks sixty, bein’ podgy. Now,
why can’t I have a stroke of luck an’ rake in a stack?
Then I might have a cut&ndash;in for the giddy widow.”</p>

<p>Evelyn’s trim figure emerged from a tree&ndash;shrouded
path. She walked with a lithe elegance that pleased
Mr. Thring’s sporting eye.</p>

<p>“Or marry a girl like <i>that</i>,” he added. The wild
improbability of ever achieving any part of this fascinating
programme brought a petulant frown to his
handsome, vacuous face.</p>

<p>He strode up to one of the gardeners, a red&ndash;whiskered
Caledonian, stern and wild.</p>

<p>“Where the devil is everybody?” he yawned. “No
shootin’, no yachtin’, not a soul in the billiard&ndash;room&mdash;where’s
the bloomin’ crowd?”</p>

<p>The dour Scot looked at him pityingly.</p>

<p>“Aiblins some are i’ bed,” he said, “an’ there’s
ithers wha ocht to be i’ bed.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you, Rob Roy,” cried Thring, who never
objected to being scored off. “Aiblins some people
are cuttin’ grass wha ocht to be under it, because they
don’t know they’re alive, eh what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“Man, but ye’re shairp the day,” retorted the gardener.
“Whiles I’m thinkin’ there’s a guid pig&ndash;jobber
lost in you, Maister Thring.”</p>

<p>“Pig&ndash;jobber, you cateran! Why pigs?”</p>

<p>“Have ye no heerd tell that fowk a bit saft i’ the
heid have a wonderfu’ way wi’ animals, an’ pigs are
always a fine mairket.”</p>

<p>“A bit heavy, McToddy. Trem yer whuskers an’
change yer trousies for a kelt, an’ mebbe ye’ll crack a
joke wi’ less deeficulty.”</p>

<p>The under&ndash;gardener chortled, for the Honorable
Billy could imitate the Scots dialect with an unction
that was decidedly mirth&ndash;provoking.</p>

<p>“Ma name’s no McToddy,” began the other.</p>

<p>“Well, then, McWhusky. I ken the noo from yer
rid neb that there’s michty little watter in yer composition.”</p>

<p>Snorting defiance, but not daring to pour forth the
wrath that boiled up in him, the man pushed a mowing&ndash;machine
savagely across the lawn.</p>

<p>“Routed!” smiled Billy. “Bannockburn is avenged!”</p>

<p>“What is amusing you, Mr. Thring?” asked Evelyn,
who had walked over the grass unheard.</p>

<p>“I have just discovered my lost vocation,” he said.
“I am a buffoon, Miss Dane, an idle jester. The only
difference between me and a music&ndash;hall comedian is
that my humor is not remunerative.”</p>

<p>“Why, when I left you last night you were on the
verge of proposing to Mrs. Laing, a most serious
undertaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Jolly nice woman, Mrs. Laing. No nonsense
about her. We’ve bin together the last half hour, an’
I’m under the starter’s orders, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Why not go in and win?” demanded Evelyn,
taking a kindly interest in the Honorable one’s matrimonial
prospects. If he and Mrs. Laing made a
match of it, that would provide a very agreeable close
to a disquieting incident.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’ll only be to make the runnin’ for some
other Johnny,” sighed he. “I was gettin’ along like
a house a&ndash;fire, when all at once she remembered she
hadn’t said what she wanted to say in a letter to a
Captain somebody at Ostend, an’ off she waltzed to
her room. She’s probably writin’ sweet nothings to
him now. Same old story&mdash;Billy Thring left at the
post. Gad, that’s funny! See it, eh, what?”</p>

<p>Thring was so amused by his own wit that he did
not notice the expression of pain and fear that drove
the brightness from Evelyn’s face. But she herself
was conscious of it, and looked away lest he should
peer into her eyes, and wonder. So Mrs. Laing was
writing to Arthur! She knew his address! How
strange, how unutterably strange, that he had not
once mentioned her name! The girl, as in a dream,
affected to be watching a boy, the son of the village
post&ndash;mistress, coming up the avenue. For the sake of
hearing her own voice in such commonplace words as
she might dare to utter, she drew her companion’s
attention.</p>

<p>“Here is our telegraph messenger,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Thring glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>“It’s for me,” he announced. “There’s a chap at
Newmarket who is the champion loser&ndash;finder of the
world, an’ I’m one of his victims. This is Leger day,
an’ if you wait a moment I’ll put you onto a stiff ‘un,
sure thing. Then you must turn bookmaker at lunch,
and win gloves right and left&mdash;in pairs, in fact. I’ll
stand your losses if my prophet has gone mad an’ sent
a winner.”</p>

<p>The boy made straight for him, and commenced to
unfasten the pouch slung to his belt.</p>

<p>“See? I told you,” laughed Billy, opening the
message.</p>

<p>Evelyn hardly understood him. She was grateful
for the high spirits that prevented him from paying
any heed to the tears trembling under her drooping
eyelashes. Despite her brave resolve to disregard
Rosamund Laing’s unbelievable story, a whole legion
of doubts and terrors now trooped in on her. She
asked herself how she could endure to live in the same
house as her rival, for five long days, until Arthur’s
answer came. Would he receive the two letters by
the same post? Could there be any real foundation
for her rival’s boast? The thought made her sick at
heart. Fighting down her dread, she turned to Thring
hoping to find a momentary oblivion in listening to his
cheerful nonsense.</p>

<p>She found oblivion, indeed, but not in the shape she
anticipated. Shading his eyes with one hand and
holding the telegram in the other, her companion was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
gazing at it in a dazed way. His cheeks were bloodless,
the hand gripping the scrap of flimsy paper shook as
though he were seized with ague, his whole attitude
was that of a man who had received an overwhelming
shock.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thring!” she cried, startled beyond measure,
“what has happened?”</p>

<p>“My God!” he wailed, with the tingling note of
agony in his voice that comes most clearly from one
whose lips are formed for laughter. “My God! And
I was jesting about them only last night!”</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it?” she cried again, catching his arm
because he swayed like one about to faint.</p>

<p>“Read!” he murmured. “Fairholme an’ the two
boys! May Heaven forgive me! To think that I
should have said it last night of all nights!”</p>

<p>Evelyn took the telegram from his palsied fingers,
and this is what she read:</p>

<p>“With deepest regret I have to inform you that the
Earl of Fairholme and his two sons were killed in the
collision at Beckminster Junction last evening. Their
private saloon was being shunted when the down
express crashed into it. Letters found on his lordship’s
body gave me your address. Every one here
joins in profound sympathy. Please wire instructions.
James Thwaite.”</p>

<p>Scarce knowing what she said, and still clinging
desperately to the stricken man at her side, Evelyn
whispered:</p>

<p>“Are they your relatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>And the answer came brokenly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know? That’s Ferdy and my nephews!
And two such boys! Straight an’ tall an’ handsome.
Good Lord! was that the only way?”</p>

<p>Then she realized the horror of it. The crushed
society butterfly, who was like to fall to the ground but
for her support, was now Earl of Fairholme. Calling
Brown to her aid, they led him inside the house. The
butler, impelled to disobey his master’s strict injunctions,
knocked at the library door, and told Baumgartner
what had happened.</p>

<p>Von Rippenbach heard. He was a callous person,
to whom the death of three Englishmen was of very
slight consideration.</p>

<p>“The very thing!” he murmured. “Now you have
your excuse. You can empty the place in twenty&ndash;four
hours.”</p>

<p>Rosamund Laing, whose white brows wore unseemly
furrows, was writing and thinking in her own room
when a maid brought her the news. Before her on
the table was Evelyn’s letter, and the sharp&ndash;eyed
Scotch lassie saw that the lady nearly upset the inkstand
in her haste to cover something with the blotting&ndash;pad.
Rosamund was shocked, of course. Finding
that Thring was leaving for the south almost immediately,
she then and there wrote a sweetly sympathetic
note, and had it taken to him.</p>

<p>“By the way,” she said before the maid went out,
“have you seen Mr. Figuero recently? I mean the
dark&ndash;skinned man who came here yesterday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Yes, he had just left the library with the master and
another gentleman. Rosamund rose at once. If she
were not greatly mistaken, Evelyn’s harmless&ndash;looking
postscript had given her a clue to the mystery of Figuero’s
presence in Baumgartner’s house. She knew
her West Africa, and the bad repute of Oku was one
of her clearest memories. Yet she turned back at the
door, took Evelyn’s letter from her pocket, copied a
portion of it, and locked the original in her jewel case.</p>

<p>The luncheon&ndash;gong sounded as she descended the
stairs, so perforce she postponed the interview she
promised herself with the Portuguese. And, for the
success of her deep&ndash;laid schemes, it was as well. Sometimes
there comes to the aid of evil&ndash;doers a fiend who
contrives opportunities where human forethought would
fail. Rosamund, embarked on a well&ndash;nigh desperate
enterprise, suddenly found the way smoothed by Baumgartner’s
wholly unexpected announcement that business
considerations compelled him to leave Lochmerig
forthwith.</p>

<p>“My wife and I would have tried to arrange matters
satisfactorily for our guests,” he said, “but the gloom
cast on our pleasant party by the unhappy tidings
received this morning by one of our number renders
it almost impossible for any of us to enjoy the remainder
of a most memorable and delightful sojourn in Scotland.”</p>

<p>He delivered himself of other platitudes, but Mrs.
Baumgartner’s dejected air and Beryl’s sulky silence
showed plainly enough that the millionaire’s fiat was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
unalterable. Polite murmurs of agreement veiled the
chagrin of people who had a fortnight or more thrown
on their hands without any prior arrangements. The
meal was a solemn function. Everybody was glad
when it ended.</p>

<p>Rosamund met Figuero in the hall.</p>

<p>“I am going to the village,” she said. “Will you
walk there with me?”</p>

<p>He caught the veiled meaning of the glance, and
agreed instantly. When they were clear of the house,
she commenced the attack.</p>

<p>“Why are you and Count von Rippenbach and three
men of Oku in England?” she asked.</p>

<p>She did not look at Figuero. There was no need.
He waited a few seconds too long before he laughed.</p>

<p>“You make joke,” he said.</p>

<p>“Do I? It will be no joke for you when Captain
Warden informs the Government, if he has not done
that already.”</p>

<p>“Why you say dem t’ing?” he growled, and she
was fully aware of the menace in his voice.</p>

<p>“You told me what you were pleased to consider a
secret last night. Very well, I am willing to trade.
Captain Warden knows what you are doing. He
probably guesses every item of the business you and
the Count were discussing so long and earnestly with
Mr. Baumgartner in the library before lunch. Oh,
please don’t interrupt”&mdash;for Figuero, driven beyond
the bounds of self&ndash;control, was using words better left
to the Portuguese tongue in which they were uttered&mdash;“I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
am not concerned with your plots. They never
come to anything, you know. If either Count von
Rippenbach or Mr. Baumgartner had your history at
their finger’s ends as I have, they would drop you like
a hot cinder. Yet, I am ready to bargain. Help me,
and I will keep my information to myself.”</p>

<p>“What you want, den?”</p>

<p>She glanced at him, and was surprised to see that
his face was livid, almost green with rage and perplexity.
It must be a grave matter&mdash;this jumble of
hints in Evelyn’s letter.</p>

<p>“Can you read English?” she asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Yes, leetle piece&mdash;better as I can make palaver.”</p>

<p>“Read that then.”</p>

<p>She handed him the copy of that part of the fateful
letter that alluded to himself and his affairs. He
puzzled it out, word by word.</p>

<p>“Where him lib for?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“That was written by Miss Dane and intended for
Captain Warden. I came by it, no matter how, and
I mean to make use of it in some way.”</p>

<p>With a rapid movement, he stuffed the sheet of note&ndash;paper
into a pocket.</p>

<p>“I keep dem letter,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Certainly. It is only a copy. Savvy? I have the
real one safely put away.”</p>

<p>Figuero swallowed something. His thin lips were
bloodless, and his tongue moistened them with the
quick darting action of a snake. Rosamund, who was
really somewhat afraid, trusted to the daylight and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
fact that they were traversing an open road, with
cottages scattered through the glen.</p>

<p>“You cannot humbug me,” she went on, “but I
want to assure you again that I am no enemy of yours.
Now, listen. I mean to marry Captain Warden, but
I have reason to believe that he is engaged, promised,
to Miss Dane. I am trying to stop that, to break it
off. Can you help?”</p>

<p>“You ask hard t’ing&mdash;in dis place. In Africa, we
get Oku man make ju&ndash;ju.”</p>

<p>She shuddered. The cold malevolence in his words
recalled stories she had heard of those who had died
with unaccountable suddenness when “Oku man
make ju&ndash;ju.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that,” she cried vehemently. “Tell
me what is taking place, and how it will affect Captain
Warden. Then I can twist events to my own purpose.
I can warn him, perhaps prove myself his friend.
Above all&mdash;where are you going to&ndash;morrow? Mr.
Baumgartner sails in the <i>Sans Souci</i>, I hear. Does
Miss Dane go with him, or is she to be sent away
because she is aware of your plans?”</p>

<p>Figuero did not answer during a whole minute.</p>

<p>He saw light, dimly, but growing more distinct each
instant. Warden was a deadly personality in the field
against him, and his active interference was now
assured beyond cavil. But, with two women as foils,
both beautiful, and one exceedingly well equipped
with money, there was still a chance of circumventing
the only man he feared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“You steal dem letter?” he said unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“At any rate, it has not gone to Captain Warden,”
was the acid reply.</p>

<p>“An’ you write ‘im. What you say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing that affects the case.”</p>

<p>“You tole him me here?”</p>

<p>“No. That can wait,” which statement, as shall be
seen, was strictly untrue.</p>

<p>“Well, den, dem yacht lib for&mdash;for somewheres to&ndash;morrow.
Dem girl, Mees Dane, go wid me. You
tole him dat t’ing as you say las’ night. I make wife
palaver to dem girl.”</p>

<p>“What good will that do?” she said. “In a week,
ten days, he will hear from her again.”</p>

<p>“No. I take dem letter. You gib me Captain
Warden writin’, an’ I keep eye for dat. Savvy?”</p>

<p>“But can you carry out what you promised?”</p>

<p>“Two, t’ree months, yes. After dem yacht lib for
Madeira, no. P’raps dem girl be wife den.”</p>

<p>Rosamund’s dark eyes narrowed to two tiny slits.
If Figuero could really keep Warden and Evelyn apart
during so long a period, the utterly hopeless project on
which she had embarked in a moment of jealous rage
might become feasible. Of course, the suggestion that
he would marry Evelyn was preposterous, but there
was no reason why she should hurt his pride by telling
him so. Her heart throbbed madly, while her active
brain debated the pros and cons of the all&ndash;important
question&mdash;should she post the letter already written?
Yes. It was the outcome of her earliest thought. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
would follow it up with another in different strain.
The two would be vastly more convincing than one,
and the dates would have a significance that no mere
contriving could impart.</p>

<p>By this time they were at the post&ndash;office, from which
mails were dispatched by a later train than that caught
by the groom. Rosamund dropped her letter in the
box. She was quite pale with suppressed excitement.
Her boats were burnt. She heard the fall of the envelope
into the receptacle, and the appalling notion
possessed her that the sound resembled the fall of earth
on a coffin. She breathed heavily, and pressed a hand
to her bosom. Figuero was watching her.</p>

<p>“Now you done dem t’ing,” he said, “you dash me
some money.”</p>

<p>She started. Did he mean to levy blackmail for his
services?</p>

<p>“Why?” she asked, summoning all her strength of
character to meet his gaze without flinching.</p>

<p>“Me buy present for dem girl. If I make wife
palaver dat cost many dollar.”</p>

<p>“I am not buying your help. You trade with me
one thing for the other. If you refuse, I write to the
Government about the men of Oku.”</p>

<p>The Portuguese laughed more naturally than she
had yet heard him. If his arch&ndash;enemy, Arthur Warden,
was well acquainted with the mission he and the chiefs
had undertaken, this pretty and passionate woman
counted for very little in the scale against him.</p>

<p>“You dash me one hunner’ poun’,” he said cheerfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
“Jus’ dat, no mo’. If you say ‘no,’ dem girl no lib
for yacht. Mr. Baumgartner say go one&ndash;time. Me
tell ‘im take dem girl&mdash;savvy?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Laing savvied. She gave him thirty pounds&mdash;all
she could spare from her purse&mdash;and promised
to send the balance to an address in London. He was
fully satisfied. He was sure she would not fail him.
When he needed further supplies she would pay willingly.
In an intrigue based on such lines Miguel
Figuero was an adept.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pc1">WARDEN BEGINS HIS ODYSSEY</p>

<p class="p2">Evelyn’s weekly letter from Scotland usually arrived
by the mail&ndash;boat due at Ostend about three o’clock in
the afternoon. Warden, sitting on the <i>plage</i> among a
cosmopolitan crowd that delighted in its own antics,
watched the steamer from Dover picking its way along
the coast and into the harbor. He was dining with a
friend that evening in one of the big hotels on the sea
front. He could call for his letters after he had dressed&mdash;meanwhile,
he had an hour or more at his disposal,
and he was weary of the frolics of Monsieur, Madame
et Bébé, and of a great many other people who came
under a less domestic category.</p>

<p>To kill time, he strolled into the Casino and drank a
cup of the decoction which Belgians regard as tea.
Then he went to the so&ndash;called Club to look at the
gamblers. Play did not appeal to him, but he had
joined the Cercle Privé because some men he knew
went there regularly for baccarat. To&ndash;day, to dispel
the <i>ennui</i> of existence between meals, a German baron
was opening banks of five hundred louis each, and
losing or winning money with a bored air. He had
just closed one bank successfully, and the table was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
set for another, when a young American, bright&ndash;eyed,
clean&ndash;shaven, and pallid, stirred the pulses of both onlookers
and players by crying, “Banco!” Even in
Ostend one does not often see four hundred pounds
won or lost at a single coup. Warden, whose sympathies
were against the stolid banker, stood by the
side of the younger man until the incident was ended.</p>

<p>There was no waiting. The challenger, impassive
as a Red Indian, gave a bundle of notes to the croupier,
who counted them. The baron dealt the two tableaux,
and his adversary stooped and picked up the first.</p>

<p>“<i>Huit!</i>” he said, throwing the cards face upwards
on the table. He took the second pair.</p>

<p>“<i>Neuf!</i>”</p>

<p>An excited buzz of talk rose around the board. With
a blasé smile, the banker showed his cards&mdash;two
queens.</p>

<p>“<i>Peste!</i>” cried a Frenchman, “<i>toujours on souffre
pour les dames!</i>”</p>

<p>Some few laughed; the German, more phlegmatic
than ever, opened a pocket&ndash;book and started a fresh
bank for the same amount, while the American collected
his stake and winnings. He was stuffing the
notes into a pocket when he caught Warden’s glance.</p>

<p>“That’s the easiest way of making two thousand
dollars I’ve ever struck,” he said.</p>

<p>“But you stood to lose the same amount,” said
Warden.</p>

<p>“Why, yes. The only difference between me and
the fellow who puts up with this beastly atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
every day for a month is that <i>he</i> fritters away his money
at five or ten dollars a pop, while I hit or miss at the
first time of asking.”</p>

<p>“You won’t play any more, then?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Me for the tall timbers with the baron’s
wad. ‘Lucky at cards, unlucky in love,’ you know,
and I’ve just heard that my best girl has made a date
with the other fellow.”</p>

<p>He walked away, erect, alert, and self&ndash;possessed.
Warden strolled to a roulette board.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that is true,” he mused.</p>

<p>Instinctively his hand went to his pocket, and he
staked a louis on 29, the year of his age. Up came
29, and he won thirty&ndash;five louis. He was so astonished
that he bent over the shoulders of a lady seated near
the foot of the table, and began mechanically to draw
in the five&ndash;hundred franc note and ten gold pieces that
were pushed by a croupier’s rake close to his own coin.</p>

<p>“But, monsieur,” whispered the lady, who was
French, and gave slight heed to convention, “certainly
you will follow your luck!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” he answered.</p>

<p>Knowing that the maximum on a number was nine
louis, he was on the point of leaving that amount on
29, when he remembered that Evelyn’s age was twenty.
To the surprise of his self&ndash;appointed counselor, he
told the croupier to transfer the gold to the new number,
while the note went on the 19&ndash;24 <i>transversale</i>.
Thus, if he lost, he was still a louis to the good, and
the American’s consoling adage was robbed of its sting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The roulette whirred round, the marble danced
madly across diamonds and slots. Checking its pace,
it hopped, hopped, hopped&mdash;into 20&mdash;and the
Frenchwoman nearly became hysterical. Warden received
so much money that he lost count. As a matter
of fact, he had won just forty louis less than the cynic
of the baccarat table. He deemed the example of the
unknown philosopher too good not to be followed, so
he gathered his gains and stakes, and left the room.</p>

<p>Now, most men would have felt elated at this stroke
of luck, but Warden was not. Though it was very
pleasant to be richer by nearly three hundred and
seventy pounds, he wished heartily that this sudden
outburst of the gambling mania had found its genesis
in some other topic than the reputed ill fortune of a
favored lover. The incident was so astounding that
he began to search for its portent. For a few seconds,
he saw in his mind’s eye an evil leer on the black face
hidden away in the <i>Nancy’s</i> cabin, and it almost gave
him a shock when he recalled the fact that both 29
and 20 were black numbers. But the light and gaiety
of the streets soon dispelled these vapors, and he loitered
in front of a jeweler’s shop while planning a surprise
for his beloved. He had not yet given her a ring.
Their tacit engagement was so sudden, and their
parting so complete since that never&ndash;to&ndash;be&ndash;forgotten
night at Plymouth, that he now fancied, with a certain
humorous dismay, that Evelyn might long have been
anticipating the receipt of some such token. Well,
she should own a ring that he could never have afforded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
but for the kindly help of the Casino. There was one
in the window marked “D’Occasion&mdash;5,000 frs.”
It contained three diamonds fit for a queen’s diadem.
He wondered whether or not, under the circumstances,
one should buy a second&ndash;hand ring. Would Evelyn
care to wear an article, however valuable, that had
once belonged to another woman? At any rate, the
stones would require re&ndash;setting, and he was not afraid
of being swindled in the purchase, because the jeweler
evidently regarded this special bargain as a magnet to
draw the eyes of passers&ndash;by to his stock.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, the ring reposed in a case in
Warden’s pocket, and he was making for the post&ndash;office.
But there was no letter from Evelyn. There would
have been, were it not locked in Mrs. Laing’s writing&ndash;case,
and Warden was no wizard that he should guess
any such development in the bewildering tumult of
events that was even then gathering around him.
Nevertheless, the clerk gave him a letter&mdash;from the
Colonial Office&mdash;asking that he should come to
London with the least possible delay.</p>

<p>Though gratifying to a man eager for recognition
in his service, the incidence of the request was annoying.
At any other time in his career he would have left
Ostend by the night mail. Now he resolved to wait
until the morrow’s midday service, and thus secure
Evelyn’s missive before his departure. He read between
the lines of the brief official message clearly
enough. Affairs were growing critical in West Africa.
At best, his advice, at worst, his immediate return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
duty, was demanded. If the latter, by hook or by
crook he would contrive to see Evelyn before he sailed
for the south.</p>

<p>He telegraphed his change of plans to Evelyn, telling
her to write to his flat in London, and asking her to
wire saying whether or not a letter was <i>en route</i> to
Ostend. He bade Peter bring the <i>Nancy</i> to Dover
and there await orders, and then joined his friend,
who was sympathetic when he heard that Warden
must leave Ostend next day.</p>

<p>“You’ll miss the racing,” he said, “and that is a
pity, because I know of one or two good things that
would have paid for your holiday.”</p>

<p>Warden laughed, and recounted his before&ndash;dinner
experiences in the Casino.</p>

<p>“By gad!” cried the other, “I wish I’d been there.
I know that German Johnny&mdash;let me see, he has a
horse running to&ndash;morrow. Here is the programme&mdash;third
race&mdash;Baron von Gröbelstein’s ‘Black Mask.’
Eh, what? Oh, that is the gee&ndash;gee’s name right enough,
but it hasn’t an earthly.”</p>

<p>To cloak his amazement, Warden pretended to be
interested in the entries. “Black Mask” was Number
Thirteen on the card. He could not help smiling.</p>

<p>“I feel rather superstitious to&ndash;day,” he said. “Will
you back that horse for me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, dear boy. But you are throwing your
money away. It’s a fifty to one shot.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind. It is the Casino’s money, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Very well. How much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>Warden’s pocket&ndash;book, reduced somewhat in bulk
by the visit to the jeweler’s, came in evidence again.</p>

<p>“Fifty louis,” he said.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, it’s rank lunacy.”</p>

<p>“Believe me, I shall not care tuppence if I lose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. Give me your address. I’ll send
you a telegram about four o’clock to&ndash;morrow. You’ll
never see your fifty any more.”</p>

<p>Never before in his life had Warden acted the spendthrift,
but any surprise he may have felt at his own
recklessness was utterly dissipated when he received
Rosamund Laing’s letter next morning. Though its
tone was studiously gossipy and cheerful, the tidings
it contained were unpleasant enough to lend significance
to the American’s dictum. Its innuendoes,
whether intentional or otherwise&mdash;and Warden was
suspicious, for he had not forgotten certain traits of
Rosamund’s character&mdash;assumed a sinister aspect
when there was neither letter nor telegram from Evelyn.</p>

<p>“My dear Arthur”&mdash;wrote this unwelcome correspondent&mdash;“I
suppose I may address you in that
manner after our once close friendship&mdash;you will
think that marvels are happening when you hear that
I am at Lochmerig. The real marvel is, however,
that I should have obtained your address. Last
evening Billy Thring&mdash;do you know him?&mdash;by the
way, he is now Lord Fairholme, since that sad railway
smash at Beckminster yesterday&mdash;well, Billy Thring
spoke of you. He means to cut you out with your
little governess friend. I don’t blame you a bit, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
she is very pretty, but, without telling tales, I would
warn you that the man who said that absence makes
the heart grow fonder was certainly not a connoisseur
in woman’s hearts. Naturally, Fairholme flew south
this morning, and that clears off one of your rivals
temporarily. Still, there are others. I am only chaffing,
of course, and I suppose you were chiefly amusing
yourself at Cowes and elsewhere. <i>My</i> presence here
is easily accounted for&mdash;I met the Baumgartners at
Madeira last winter; and they invited me to their Scotch
shooting. Isn’t B. a funny little man? On the island
they used to call him by his initials, I. D. B.&mdash;Illicit
Diamond Buyer, you know.</p>

<p>“Now, why did you leave me to fish out your whereabouts
by sheer accident? Naughty! Do write soon,
and tell me when I shall see you. Oh, I was nearly
forgetting. Recent arrivals included a Herr von Rippenbach
and an old acquaintance of yours, Miguel
Figuero. Isn’t it odd that they should come here!
And a little bird named Evelyn has whispered that the
men of Oku are making ju&ndash;ju nearer home than the
Benuë River. Please keep out of it, for your friends’
sake, and especially for the sake of yours ever sincerely,
Rosamund.”</p>

<p>“P.S. Send a line, and I shall give you more news.
R.”</p>

<p>There was hardly a word in that innocent&ndash;looking
note that was not a barbed shaft. Was it believable
that Evelyn Dane, the girl whose eyes shone so divinely
while he entrusted to her willing ears his hopes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
aspirations, should make him the butt of the ninnies
gathered at Lochmerig? Yet, that allusion to the
men of Oku inflicted a stab cruel as the thrust of an
Oku spear. Who else but Evelyn could have revealed
his interest in the visit of the negroes to England?
And who was this Billy Thring&mdash;whose very name
suggested inanity? True, Evelyn had mentioned him
as one of the house party. “I find the Honorable
One very amusing,” she had said. “He is the clown
of our somewhat dull circus.” But there was no suggestion
of friendliness other than the ordinary civilities
of life under the same roof. Again, why had she not
written, nor answered his telegram? He laid no great
stress on these minor things. They became important
only in the light of Rosamund’s statements.</p>

<p>He read and re&ndash;read the letter while crossing the
Channel. Before Dover was reached he had gone
through identically the same thought&ndash;process as Evelyn
herself two days earlier. He found malevolence in
every line of Rosamund’s epistle. It was meant to
wound. Its airy comment was distilled poison, its
assumed levity the gall of a jealous woman. Were it
not for her wholly inexplicable and confusing allusion
to the Oku chief’s mission, he could have cast aside
with a scornful laugh her sly hints as to Evelyn’s faithlessness.
Even then, puzzled and angry though he was,
he remained true in his allegiance to his affianced wife.</p>

<p>“Why should there not be some devil’s brew where
such men as Figuero and Baumgartner foregather?”
he asked himself. “It exists, as I well know, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Rosamund Laing is just the woman to sip it. I wish
now that I had insisted more firmly on Evelyn’s removal
from the Baumgartner gang. I was mad not
to ask her to marry me at once. We could have managed
somehow, and she would have borne the separation
for a year or more.”</p>

<p>Then it occurred to him that the two hundred pounds’
worth of diamonds in his pocket would almost have
furnished a country cottage, and, to crown all, there
was the exquisite folly of the bet on a horse that his
sporting friend described as a hopeless outsider. His
misery was not complete till the memory of another
jewel intruded itself&mdash;a ruby that had waited two
hundred and fifty years for an owner. Certainly,
Arthur Warden experienced a most perplexed and
soul&ndash;tortured journey to London.</p>

<p>He drove straight to his flat. Two telegrams awaited
him. One must be from Evelyn, of course. She had
chosen to send a message there, rather than risk missing
him at Ostend. But he was wrong. The first he
opened read: “Baumgartner and everybody else have
gone. I am coming to London. Staying at Savoy.
Rosamund.”</p>

<p>His brain was still confused by this strange substitution
of one woman for another, when his eyes fell on
the contents of the second telegram:</p>

<p>“Black Mask won. Took you forties. Congratulations,
Dick.”</p>

<p>The perplexity in his face attracted the sympathy of
the hall porter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“I ‘ope you’ve had no bad news, sir,” said the man.</p>

<p>Warden laughed with a harshness that was not good
to hear.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “just the reverse. I backed a horse
and he has won, at forty to one.”</p>

<p>The hall porter, like most of his class, was a sportsman.</p>

<p>“Lord love a duck!” he cried, “that’s the sort you
read about but seldom see, sir. Where did he run&mdash;at
Newmarket?”</p>

<p>“No, at Ostend.”</p>

<p>The man’s hopes of obtaining good “information”
diminished, but he was supremely interested.</p>

<p>“<i>Wot</i> a price!” he exclaimed. “Did you have
much on, sir?”</p>

<p>“Forty pounds.”</p>

<p>“Forty pounds! Then you’ve won sixteen hundred
quid!” and each syllable was a crescendo of admiration.</p>

<p>Warden threw the telegram on the floor. Though
the last twenty&ndash;four hours had enriched him by nearly
five years’ pay, he was in no mood to greet his good
fortune as it deserved.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he sighed, “I suppose you are right. Unpack
my traps, there’s a good fellow. I am going out,
and I want to change my clothes.”</p>

<p>The hall porter obeyed, but he would have choked
if speech were forbidden. He wanted to know the
horse’s name, how the gentleman had come to hear of
him, was the money “safe,” and other kindred items
that goaded Warden to hidden frenzy. Yet the forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
attention thus demanded was good for him. He
described “Black Mask” as “a Tartar of the Ukraine
breed,” and drew such a darksome picture of the
precautions taken by the “stable” to conceal the
animal’s true form that the man regarded him as a
veritable fount of racing lore.</p>

<p>Such a reputation, once earned, is not easily shaken
off. When he went out, the hall porter and the driver
of a hansom were in deep converse. He paid the
cabman at the Colonial Office, and his mind was busy
with other things when he was brought back to earth
again.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir,” said cabby, “but would you
mind tellin’ me the best thing for the Cup.”</p>

<p>“What Cup?” demanded Warden testily.</p>

<p>“The Liverpool Cup, sir.”</p>

<p>“Beer, of course.”</p>

<p>He escaped. But the cabman took thought. An
eminent brewer’s horse figured in the betting lists, so
he drove back at once to interview the hall porter. A
joint speculation followed, and two men mourned for
many a day that they had not begged or borrowed
more money wherewith to win a competence on that
amazingly lucky tip.</p>

<p>Warden did not expect to find any one at the Colonial
Office who would attend to him. The hour was nearly
seven, and it is a popular theory that at four o’clock
all secretaries and civil servants throw aside the newspapers
and other light literature with which they beguile
the tedium of official routine. He meant to report his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
arrival in London, and learn from a door&ndash;keeper what
time it would be advisable to call next day.</p>

<p>He was hardly prepared, therefore, to be received
forthwith by a silver&ndash;haired, smooth&ndash;spoken gentleman,
who asked him to recapitulate the main points of his
conversation with the Under Secretary at the Foreign
Office.</p>

<p>Somewhat mystified, Warden began his recital.
After the first two sentences, the official nodded.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Captain Warden, I need not trouble
you further,” he said. “You see, we are not personally
known to each other, and in such an exceedingly delicate
matter as this threatened difficulty in Nigeria&mdash;wherein
knowledge is confined to a very small circle&mdash;one
has to be careful that one is speaking to the
right man.”</p>

<p>“Did you think it possible, then, that some stranger
might have impersonated me?” demanded Warden,
his eyes twinkling at the suggestion.</p>

<p>“Quite possible. I have done it myself twice, the
first time successfully, the second to the complete
satisfaction of our Minister abroad, but hardly to my
own, as I had two fingers of my left hand shot off while
making a dash for safety.”</p>

<p>Certainly, reflected Warden, there were elements in
the life of Whitehall that escaped public notice.</p>

<p>“We have sent for you because you are wanted at
once in West Africa,” went on the other. “Letters to
and from the Governor of Northern Nigeria have
culminated in a cablegram from the Governor asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that you should be recalled from furlough. Though
you are attached to the southern portion of the Protectorate,
his Excellency has the highest appreciation
of your tact and ability. He thinks you are the man
best fitted to deal with the natives of the disturbed
region. It is not proposed that you should return by
the ordinary mail service. We assume that the departure
of officers and others for Lagos is closely
watched at the present crisis. A passage has been
secured on a coasting steamer for a mythical personage
named Alfred Williams. Initials on baggage or linen,
therefore, cannot cause inquiry. Now, the <i>Water
Witch</i> sails from Cardiff by Saturday afternoon’s tide,
and we would like Mr. Alfred Williams to go on board
that morning.”</p>

<p>Warden looked blankly at the speaker. It was then
Thursday. It left him little more than a day in which
to unravel the mystery that enveloped Evelyn and her
whereabouts. A bitter rage welled up in his breast,
but he controlled his face, and the official attributed
his silence to the suddenness of his suggested departure.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that your leave should be spoiled in
this fashion,” continued the quiet voice. “But it is
unavoidable. The thing presses. And I need scarcely
tell you that when Government wants a man’s service
it is good for the man.”</p>

<p>“I shall be on board the <i>Water Witch</i> on Saturday,”
said Warden.</p>

<p>Perhaps the lack of enthusiasm in his manner was
puzzling, but the suave official paid no heed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now for your instructions,” he said. “The
vessel touches at Cape Coast Castle before going on
to Lagos. You will be met there by some officer whom
you are acquainted with. He will tell you the exact
position of affairs, and what, if any, developments
have taken place in the meantime. He will also give
you the Governor’s views as to the way in which your
experience of the natives can best be utilized. I leave
it to you to take the necessary precautions to conceal
your movements and identity, and I am authorized to
hand you £250 to meet any expenses incidental to
your mission. Your passage on the <i>Water Witch</i> is
paid for, by the way.”</p>

<p>Again the older man failed to understand why the
young officer should laugh with the grim humor of
one who bids fate do her worst. Certainly, the situation
had in it some element of comedy. Gold was
being showered on Warden from the skies&mdash;promotion
and distinction were thrust upon him&mdash;yet he
was miserable as any man in England that day.</p>

<p>“Something on his mind&mdash;is it a woman?” mused
the shrewd official, and the time came when he remembered
the idle fancy.</p>

<p>In the freedom of the street Warden soon recovered
himself. Not even an all&ndash;absorbing passion&mdash;rendered
more intense by reason of his self&ndash;contained
nature&mdash;could deprive him of the habit of years.
In the Colonial Office at the moment lay a letter from
the Governor of Southern Nigeria commending him
in the highest terms for his cool judgment, resourcefulness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and decision. He showed these qualities now.
He hurried to Charing Cross, and despatched three
telegrams, one to Evelyn, begging her to communicate
with him instantly, a second to his friend in Ostend,
thanking him for his kindly offices and requesting that
the money should be paid into a named bank, and the
third to the Harbor Master at Dover, asking him to
inform Peter Evans, of the pilot&ndash;cutter <i>Nancy</i>, that he
must travel to London by the earliest train after arriving
from Ostend.</p>

<p>Then he went to the Savoy.</p>

<p>Rosamund’s telegram had been handed in at Lochmerig
the previous night. It occurred to Warden that
she must have written it about the time his message to
Evelyn was delivered. If so, and it was true that the
Baumgartner household had already departed on board
the <i>Sans Souci</i>, there was an obvious question to be
answered.</p>

<p>As he anticipated, Mrs. Laing was in the hotel. In
fact, she was about to dine in her own room when
Warden’s card was brought to her. She hastened to
meet him, all smiles and blushes.</p>

<p>“How awfully good of you to come so soon!” she
cried. “And at just the right hour! I hate eating
alone, but I dislike still more being at a table by myself
in a big hotel. You can’t have dined. Let us go to
the café, and then it doesn’t matter about one’s toilette.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wish to disturb your arrangements”&mdash;he
began, but she was not to be forced into a serious discussion
at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who said anything about disturbance?” she
rattled on. “You could not have met my wishes
better if you had guessed them. Now, don’t look so
glum. It is not my fault that your pretty governess
was ready to flirt with other men, is it? Come and
eat, and I shall tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>He fell in with her mood. A woman will dare anything
when she loves or hates, and he credited Rosamund
with excess in both directions. Yet it would be
strange, he thought, were she playing some deep game
not immediately discernible, if he did not unravel the
tangled skein of her deceit.</p>

<p>“I got your letter, of course,” he said when they
were seated.</p>

<p>“Ah, then I guessed correctly. That is why you
are disconsolate,” she said, looking at him frankly.</p>

<p>“It may be. At present I am chiefly curious. How
did you obtain my London address?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you telegraph it?”</p>

<p>“To Miss Dane&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>“You dear man, what would <i>you</i> have done if a
telegram were brought to a remote place in the Highlands
for a lady whom you knew was gone goodness
knows where in a yacht?”</p>

<p>“Surely it might have been forwarded to her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you or I, or any other reasonable being,
were the addressee. But the Baumgartners gave instructions
that everything was to be sent to their
London house, which is closed, except for a caretaker.
Mrs. Baumgartner herself told me they did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
not expect to be in town under a month or six
weeks.”</p>

<p>“Have they vanished into thin air?”</p>

<p>“Something of the kind. They spoke vaguely of a
cruise round the Shetlands, but I am sure that was
meant as a blind. They wouldn’t take Figuero and
von Rippenbach as their sailing companions for the
mere fun of the thing, would they?”</p>

<p>“Did they offer no excuse to their guests?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Billy Thring&mdash;sorry, but I must mention
him&mdash;well, his brother’s death was the ostensible
reason. I don’t believe a word of it. I. D. B. is not
the man to break up a pleasant house party because
one of its members has suffered a bereavement. There
is something else going on. I am honestly feminine
enough to want to know what it is. I was simply
dying of curiosity yesterday when I saw Figuero and
the dainty Evelyn in the garden, discussing things
with bated breath.”</p>

<p>Warden frowned. He could keep a tight rein on his
emotions, but this was trying him high.</p>

<p>“Would you mind telling me how a man who is
dining with a lady can best express polite incredulity
at her statements?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Very neat,” she retorted, “but in this instance you
are the water and I the duck. If you think I am
deliberately telling you untruths, why not choose some
less exciting topic? How did you like Ostend? I
adore it. The people amuse me&mdash;they are so naïvely
shocking, or shocked, as the case may be. Did you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
see that fat Frenchman who struts about in a ridiculously
tight and glaring bathing suit?”</p>

<p>“Of course you want to talk about Lochmerig,” he
said quietly. “Now, Mrs. Laing, it will be wiser to
speak in plain language. Evelyn Dane is my promised
wife. If possible, I would marry her to&ndash;morrow.
That is no figure of speech. If she were here now,
and the law permitted, I would marry her within the
hour. You know me well enough to believe that once
my mind is made up I do not change. Well, then,
why are you endeavoring to create discord between me
and the woman I love?”</p>

<p>Rosamund flushed. She had expected him to say
something of the kind, but it was none the less disagreeable
in the hearing. The fury that convulsed
her found a ready outlet in the tears that stood in her
beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>“It is very unkind of you to blame me,” she half
sobbed. “How could I make up all these wicked
inventions? I had never even heard the girl’s name
before I went to Lochmerig. It was her own foolish
tongue that revealed things&mdash;about you&mdash;and the
men of Oku&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;what you saw that night
at Cowes. She is either very wicked or very thoughtless,
Arthur. If you are engaged in some secret business
for the Government, and she were really true to
you, would she ever have spoken of it to Billy&mdash;to
Lord Fairholme?”</p>

<p>Warden was beaten. He poured out a glass of wine
and drank it. He felt that if he spoke at once his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
voice might betray the agony of his soul. Ah, if only
he might see Evelyn for five precious minutes! Better
go to Africa with his dear idol shattered than carry
with him the lingering torture of doubt.</p>

<p>“I think you were right when you switched our talk
off to Ostend,” he muttered at last. “May I give you
a word of advice? Forget what you have just said.
It is a dangerous problem&mdash;one not to be settled by
women’s tongues.”</p>

<p>So they left it at that, and when they parted, not
without a tacit understanding that they would meet
again at the earliest opportunity&mdash;for Warden was
obliged to be ambiguous in that respect&mdash;Rosamund
was sure that she had gained some ground in a pitiless
struggle. Warden was desperately unhappy. That
was her second success. She had won the first move
when the <i>Sans Souci</i> carried Evelyn off the field.</p>

<p>Early next morning Warden went to a shipping
office, and the people there advised him to send a
reply&ndash;paid telegram to the coast&ndash;guard station nearest
Lochmerig. He soon received an answer. “The
<i>Sans Souci</i> sailed Wednesday, 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Destination
believed Shetlands, but headed southeast by east.”</p>

<p>He passed many hours in writing a full statement of
everything that had taken place&mdash;including copies of
Rosamund’s letter and telegram, and a literal record
of their conversation in the hotel&mdash;and enclosed the
ring and the manuscript in a stout linen envelope.
When Peter Evans came to him in the evening, he
gave him the package and fifty pounds, with explicit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
details as to its safeguarding and the reasons which
governed his present decision.</p>

<p>“You are to find Miss Dane, no matter what the
cost,” he said. “You may hear of her at her home in
Oxfordshire, or at this address, where you have my
permission to open any letters that arrive during my
absence. If you run short of money, or are compelled
to take an expensive journey, apply to my bankers. I
shall leave full instructions that your requirements are
to be met when you explain them. The one thing I
want you to do is to deliver this letter into Miss Dane’s
own hands.”</p>

<p>Peter, somewhat awestricken by Warden’s gravity,
yet proud of the trust placed in him, promised obedience.</p>

<p>“Never fear, sir,” he said. “If the <i>Sans Souci</i> is
afloat on the seven seas I’ll get her bearin’s one way or
another. Sink me! if I don’t find that gal afore a
month, I’ll unship my prop, sell the <i>Nancy</i>, an’ go to
the wokkus.”</p>

<p>In disposing of his belongings, Warden packed the
gourd and the parchment among some heavy clothing
which was useless in Africa. He told the hall porter
exactly which portmanteaus he meant to take with
him, but on arriving at Paddington Station at 4.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
on a cold morning, he found the bag containing the
gourd and parchment piled with the rest of his goods
on the platform.</p>

<p>He eyed it resentfully, but yielded.</p>

<p>“So you mean to stick to me!” he growled. “You
mesmerized that sleepy scoundrel into carrying you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
downstairs and depositing you on the roof of my cab.
Very well. Let us see the adventure through in company.”</p>

<p>He was chatting with the skipper of the <i>Water Witch</i>
one day while the ship’s position was being pricked
off on the chart.</p>

<p>“You are keeping close in to the Spanish coast,
Captain,” said the passenger.</p>

<p>“Not particularly, Mr. Williams,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“But I have always been under the impression that
vessels bound for the West Coast headed for the
Canaries?”</p>

<p>“So they do, if they’re logged for a straight run. It
happens this time, however, that my ole tub has to call
in at Rabat and Mogador.”</p>

<p>“At Rabat!” repeated Mr. Williams, seemingly
staggered at the mere mention of the place.</p>

<p>“Yes, funny little hole. Ever bin there?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, p’raps you’ll go ashore. If you do you’ll see
the queerest collection of humans you’ve ever set eyes
on.”</p>

<p>Mr. Williams turned and gazed at the horizon.</p>

<p>“I think I’m bewitched,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Wot’s that?”</p>

<p>“Odd thing. I’ve been dreaming of Rabat!”</p>

<p>The captain grinned.</p>

<p>“When you’ve seen it you’ll fancy it’s a nightmare,”
he said.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pc1">HASSAN’S TOWER&mdash;AND THE COLONIAL OFFICE</p>

<p class="p2">Warden did not find Rabat so intolerable as the
captain of the <i>Water Witch</i> led him to believe. Its
streets were more regular and cleaner, or less dirty,
than those of the average Moorish town. Its people
seemed to be devoted to commerce&mdash;probably because
they are not pure&ndash;blooded Moors, but of Jewish descent.
That, at least, is the argument advanced by a man
from Fez or Tafilat when he wants a heavier dowry
with a Rabati bride.</p>

<p>From the roadstead, once the troublesome bar was
crossed, the town looked attractive. Its white houses
were enshrined in pretty gardens. Orchards, vineyards,
and olive&ndash;groves brightened the landscape. To
the north, on the opposite bank of a swift river, cultivated
slopes stretched their green and gold to the
far&ndash;off Zemmur mountains. A picturesque citadel,
built by a renegade Englishman in the bad old days,
commanded the harbor, and a spacious landing&ndash;place
showed that the Rabatis opposed no difficulties to the
export of their Morocco leather, carpets, Moorish
slippers, and pottery.</p>

<p>The <i>Water Witch</i> entered the river soon after dawn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and Warden was assured that she would not be able
to clear her shipments until next forenoon at the earliest.
He went ashore and was agreeably surprised at finding
quite a large number of British and other European
merchants’ offices near the quay, while the shields of
several Vice&ndash;Consuls and Consular Agents bespoke
some semblance of law and order.</p>

<p>In a word, Rabat looked settled and prosperous.
It was utterly out of keeping with the picture conjured
up by the tattoo marks made by Domenico Garcia on
the skin of Tommaso Rodriguez. Still the Hassan
Tower was no myth. It was pointed out to him by
an Englishman who had walked to the wharf to watch
the landing of the ship’s boat.</p>

<p>Pausing only to buy a strong chisel in a native shop,
Warden strolled at once in the direction of the tomb.
He would neither delay his search for the ruby, nor
give much time to it. If he failed to identify the exact
spot described in the parchment, or was unable to
discover anything after a speedy examination, assuredly
he would not spend several hours in tearing ancient
masonry to pieces. Since leaving England, Warden
had become a different man. Always a good&ndash;humored
cynic, he was now perilously near the less tolerable
condition of cynicism without good humor. Intellect
began to govern impulse. Though his brain was
wearied with endeavor to find a reasonable explanation
of events, he was almost convinced that Evelyn must
at least have committed the indiscretion of gossiping
about her adventures in the Isle of Wight. If only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
she had written! His heart kept harping on that!
Why had she flown away with her employers without
ever a sign that her thoughts were with the man
she loved?</p>

<p>He wondered if Peter Evans had found her. If so,
there would be news at Cape Coast Castle, for he had
given his bankers explicit directions, and a member of
the firm was a personal friend who would attend to
cablegrams and letters.</p>

<p>The Hassan Tower stood on a height not far beyond
the outermost city wall, Rabat being dignified with
two lines of fortifications, built by Christian slaves
centuries ago. Indeed, when Warden climbed the hill
of which it formed the pinnacle, he realized that it was
a landmark shown on a chart he had examined the
previous evening. Square and strong, built to defy
destruction, and rearing its one hundred and fifty feet
of exquisitely fretted stonework from a tangled undergrowth
of stunted vegetation, it seemed, in some proud
and curiously subtle way, to promise the fulfilment of
Domenico Garcia’s bequest.</p>

<p>Great marble columns, many erect, but the majority
overthrown, indicated the quadrangle of what was
meant to be a gigantic mosque. Warden passed
quickly through these and other ruins; he caught a hint
of an aqueduct, looked into a deep excavation evidently
designed as a cistern, and then, with somewhat more
rapid pulse&ndash;beat, and a certain awed wonderment
dominating his mind, made straight for the causeway
that led to the “door three cubits from the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>To his chagrin, though the inclined plane itself
might be ridden by a man on horseback, the arched
door was solidly built up.</p>

<p>Here was an unforeseen check. It was one thing to
be conscious of a cooling of the ardor that vowed the
adornment of Evelyn’s fair hand with a “gem of great
price,” but it was none the less baffling and exasperating
to be at the foot of the tower and meet an apparently
insuperable obstacle of this nature. Was he brought
to Rabat by the most extraordinary series of events
that could well have befallen him, only to find blind
fate smiling maliciously? The thought was not to be
borne. Somehow, anyhow, that tower must be entered,
or the spirit of the hapless Garcia would haunt him
for ever.</p>

<p>He looked around, thinking his Arabic would serve
him in good stead were there a goat&ndash;herder or other
tender of flocks near at hand. But he was quite alone
on the tiny plateau. A couple of great storks which
had built their nest on top of the tower looked down
at him with wise eyes. Hundreds of pigeons fluttered
about the summit or clung to the ridges of fretted
stone, while the only window visible above the doorway
was a hundred feet from the base.</p>

<p>But a soldier knows that every position, however
impregnable in front, may be turned from the flanks.
Before formulating any method of attack, he decided
to survey the stronghold from all points of view, and,
because Garcia mentioned the “third window on the
left,” he went to the left. On that side there were only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
two windows, each twenty feet or more above his head,
and Warden was nearly six feet in height. Then he
reflected that the Portuguese, writing his sorrowful
legend “to pleasure that loathly barbarian, M’Wanga,
King of Benin,” would surely count from the inside
of the tower.</p>

<p>On he went, noting each cranny and fissure in the
weather&ndash;beaten mass, until he reached the opposite
side. Here were three windows, and, most gratifying
of discoveries, he saw that the Arabs had contrived a
means of entry and egress through the center window
by scooping away the mortar between the huge blocks
of granite used for the foundation story. Débris had
accumulated close to the wall in such quantity that the
window&ndash;sill was not more than fourteen feet from his
eyes. To an active, barefooted Moor, with toes and
fingers like the talons of a vulture, the climb would
present no difficulty whatever. To a man whose nails
were well kept, and whose toes would speedily be
lacerated if not protected by boots, the scaling of the
rough wall was no child’s play. But Warden began
to crawl upwards without a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>He knew that the ascent would be easy compared
with the return, while a fall meant the risk of a bad
sprain, so he memorized each suitable foothold as he
mounted, and often paused to make sure of the deepest
niches. It must be confessed that no thought of other
danger entered into his calculations. His military
training should have made him more wary, but what
had either experience or text&ndash;book to do with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
quest of a jewel, hidden for safety in a Moorish tomb
so many years ago?</p>

<p>And he was armed, too, quite sufficiently to account
for any prowling thieves who might be tempted to
attack a stranger. A service revolver reposed in one
pocket, and the chisel in another&mdash;but there did not
seem to be the remotest probability of human interference;
he had not seen a living thing save the birds
since he breasted the hill.</p>

<p>When his hands rested on the broken stonework of
the window he was naturally elated. Soon his eyes
drew level with it, and he could peer into the interior.
It was all one great apartment, not lofty, though an
arched roof gave an impression of height. A staircase
led to the upper stories, but it was broken. Desolation
reigned supreme. Some startled pigeons flew out
with loud clutter of wings at the sight of him. Then
he raised himself steadily up, and leaped inside, while
the walls echoed the noise of his spring with the hollow
sound of sheer emptiness.</p>

<p>There was plenty of light, but, after a first hasty
glance, he gave no further scrutiny to his surroundings.
Were he spying out the land in an enemy’s country, he
would have looked at the littered floor to find traces of
any recent visitor. Most certainly he would not have
begun operations in Garcia’s hiding&ndash;place without first
visiting the upper rooms. But he was too eager and
excited to be prudent. Evelyn seemed to be very
near him at that moment. He remembered how her
impetuous attempt to throw the calabash into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Solent had led to the discovery of Garcia’s amazing
manuscript, and there was the spice of true romance
in the fact that now, little more than two months later,
he should actually be standing in “the tomb of the
infidel buried outside the wall” of Rabat. His fingers
itched to be at work. He was spurred by an intense
curiosity. He felt that the finding of the ruby would
lend credence to an otherwise unbelievable story. It
connected Oku and the wild Benuë of two and a half
centuries ago with Cowes and the Solent in Regatta
Week. It made real the personality of a long&ndash;forgotten
tyrant, who perchance lived again to&ndash;day in one of
those three negroes he had seen in Figuero’s company.
No wonder, then, that Warden was impatient. Ten
seconds after he had reached the interior of the building,
he was bent over the “deep crack between the
center stones” of the window described by Garcia.</p>

<p>There could be no doubting now which window the
scribe meant. It stood next to that by which Warden
had entered, and, sure enough, just in that place the
stones were more than ordinarily wide apart. The
word “crack” was ambiguous. It might be applied
more accurately to a break in one particular stone,
but Warden was no adept in the Portuguese tongue,
and the dictionary&ndash;maker might be translating “interstice,”
or “crevice,” or “division,” when he wrote
“crack.” At any rate, the “center stones” were
sound, but the mortar between them was partly eaten
away, and Warden saw at once that in order to make
good his search one of the stones must be prised out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
bodily. A crowbar would have ended the job in a
minute when once the chisel had cut a leverage, but,
in the absence of a crowbar, he set to work with the
chisel.</p>

<p>The mortar became flint&ndash;like when the deodorizing
influence of the weather ceased to make itself felt.
Nevertheless, the amateur house&ndash;breaker labored manfully.
Half an hour’s persistent chipping and twisting
of the tool was rewarded by a sullen loosening of the
stone.</p>

<p>Then he lifted it out of its bed, and there, nestling
between it and its fellow, hidden beneath a layer of
dust and feathers, lay a ring!</p>

<p>Now, Domenico Garcia spoke of a “ruby,” not of
a ring, but it needed no skilled eye to detect the cause
of that seeming discrepancy. The ring was a crude
affair, made of gold, it is true, but fashioned with
rough strength merely to provide a safe means of
carrying the great, dark stone held in its claws. Garcia
did not waste words. To him the ring was naught,
so why mention it?</p>

<p>The gold was discolored, of course, and the ruby did
not reveal its red splendor until Warden had cleansed
it with his handkerchief and breathed on it repeatedly
to soften the dirt deposited on its bright facets by
thousands of rainstorms. Then it was born again
before his eyes. With a thrill of pity rather than
gratification he gazed on its new and glowing life.
“Friend, I am many marches from Rabat but few from
death!” said the man who placed it there, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
that perchance he “might escape.” Now his very
bones were as the dust which had shrouded it
during all those years, yet the wondrous fire in its
heart shone forth as though it had left the lapidary’s
bench but yesterday. Warden even smiled sadly
when he realized that, no matter how his wooing fared,
such a huge gem could never shine on Evelyn Dane’s
slim finger. It was large enough to form the centerpiece
of some stately necklace or tiara. He knew
little about the value of precious stones, but this ruby
was the size of a large marble. He had once seen a
diamond that weighed twenty&ndash;four carats, and the
ruby was much the larger of the two. He fancied he
had read somewhere that a flawless ruby was of considerably
higher intrinsic worth than a diamond of the
same dimensions. The diamond he had in mind was
priced at three thousand pounds. If, then, this ruby
were flawless, its appearance in England would create
something of a sensation.</p>

<p>And Garcia’s story was true&mdash;that was the most
astounding part of the business. The magnificent
jewel winked and blinked in the sunlight. It might
almost be alive, and telling him in plain language that
the gods do not lead men into strange paths without
just cause.</p>

<p>Suddenly he caught a blood&ndash;red flash that reminded
him of the uncanny gleam in the eyes of the face on
the gourd. The thought was disquieting, but he
laughed.</p>

<p>“I am becoming a mere bundle of nerves,” he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
aloud. “The sooner I get soaked with quinine the
fitter I shall be. It must be the malaria in my system
that makes me see things. Really, the proper thing to
do now is to give that beastly mask to the head ju&ndash;ju
man at Oku. Then it will be off my hands, and he
will own the boss fetish of the whole West Coast.”</p>

<p>He was about to pocket the ring when the question
of its subsequent disposal occurred to him. It was
such a remarkable object that any one who saw it could
not fail to question him as to its history. Under existing
circumstances, he did not court inquiry in that
shape, and the queer notion came that, in all likelihood,
its prior owner carried it slung round his neck.</p>

<p>“Yes, by Jove, and the cord strangled him,” murmured
Warden. Nevertheless, not being in the least
superstitious, he might have adopted that plan of concealing
it if he possessed a stout piece of cord or strong
ribbon. But his pockets contained neither one nor
the other, and a sharp pang came with the recollection
that, in a case of similar need not so long ago, Evelyn’s
hussif held a neat coil of tape that would have suited
his purpose exactly.</p>

<p>Inside his waistcoat, however, was a secret pocket
for carrying paper money. It was provided with a
flap and a button, and would serve admirably as a
hiding&ndash;place until he was able to entrust the ruby to
a bank for transference to London. So there it went,
making a little lump over his heart, and reminding him
constantly that Domenico Garcia had not deceived him.</p>

<p>He was about to climb down again when his glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
fell on the displaced stone. As a tribute to poor Garcia’s
memory, he put it back in its bed, and even took
the trouble to pour a few handfuls of dust and loose
mortar into the joints, so that none might know it had
ever been removed. While thus occupied, his attention
was momentarily drawn to a pair of storks circling
lazily above the tower. He wondered if they were the
same placid couple that had watched him earlier. No
bird is more wide&ndash;awake than the stork, despite its
habitual air of sleepy indifference, and Warden fancied
that the noise he made must have disturbed the two
sentinels on the top of the building.</p>

<p>The hill&ndash;side was absolutely deserted. Far below
nestled the white mass of the town, its long, low, whitewashed
rectangles broken only by clumps of trees and
an occasional dome or minaret. Near the quay lay
the <i>Water Witch</i>. Her cranes were busy, two strings
of coolies were rushing back and forth across a broad
gangway, and the first mate was directing operations
from the bridge. Warden smiled. He had heard the
flow of language at the “Chief’s” command when
some incident on ship&ndash;board demanded the reading of
the Riot Act, and he could well imagine the way in
which those scampering Arabs were being incited to
strenuous effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>It was peaceful up here in the tower&mdash;so cool and
remote from the noisy life of the port that he was
tempted to linger. But if he would regain the shelter
of some café in the town ere the sun became unbearably
hot, he must be on the move. So, with a sigh for the
unhappy Garcia’s fate, and a farewell glance at the
vaulted room which had witnessed that by&ndash;gone tragedy,
and perhaps many another, he began the descent.
Thanks to the precautions taken during the climb, he
found no great difficulty in placing his toes in the right
niches. He was already below the level of the window,
and was halting with both feet wedged into a broader
crevice than usual while he changed his hand hold,
when something, whether mere intuition or a slight
sound, he never afterward knew, caused him to look
straight up.</p>

<p>Leaning over the top of the ruin, and in a direct line
above his head, was a Moor of fantastic appearance.
A blue cotton garment of vivid hue seemed to have lent
its dye to the man’s face and hair. Had he been
soused in a bath of indigo he could not have been
colored more completely. Though this extraordinary
apparition was fully one hundred and thirty feet above
Warden’s head, there was no mistaking the malice that
gleamed from the dark eyes gazing down on the Nazarene.
Under such conditions thought is quick, and
Warden was sure that he had unwittingly invaded the
sanctuary of a Mohammedan fanatic. He was minded
to whip out the revolver and fire a shot that would at
least scare this strange being back into his eyrie. But
a British sense of fair play stopped him. The blue
man, howsoever wild&ndash;looking, had not interfered with
or molested him in any way. He himself was the intruder.
The fact that he was undeniably startled did
not justify the use of a bullet, even for scaring purposes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
The best thing to do was to reach the ground as speedily
as might be, risking a jump when he was low enough
to select a particular stone on which to alight. His
dominant feeling at the moment was one of pique that
he had failed to interpret correctly the flight of the
storks. If the zealot on top of the tower meant mischief
it would have been far better to have met him in
one of the upper rooms than to be at his mercy while
clinging like a fly to the face of the wall.</p>

<p>He was within ten feet of the pile of rough stones,
and was about to drop on one larger than its fellows&mdash;in
fact, he was already in the air, having sprung slightly
outward, when a crushing blow on his head and left
shoulder flung him violently on to the very slab of
granite he was aiming for. The shock was so violent
that he felt no pain. Consciousness was acute for a
fraction of a second. He understood that a heavy
stone had fallen or been dropped purposely from the
summit of the tower, and that his change of position,
helped perhaps by the arched crown of his pith hat,
had prevented it from striking directly on top of his
head. But that was all. He lay there, with his back
propped awkwardly against the tower, staring up at
the sky. He saw nothing but the bright dome of
heaven. It seemed to be curiously near, and its glowing
bounds were closing in on him with the speed of
light. Then the veil fell, and there was merciful darkness.</p>

<p>Consternation reigned in Rabat next morning. The
Captain of the <i>Water Witch</i> began the disturbance over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
night, but when daylight brought no tidings of the
missing Englishman, the British Vice&ndash;Consul talked
most unfeelingly of a visit by the West Coast Squadron.
A worried and anxious Bey, well aware that Morocco
had troubles in plenty without Rabat adding to the
store, protested that the Nazarene must have been
spirited away without human agency. The Bey was
not listened to, so he tried honestly to find out what
had become of Warden. The only ascertainable facts
were that the Giaour had bought a chisel, and was
seen going to the tower of Hassan, the way to which
was shown to him by one of his own countrymen. The
hour was early, soon after sunrise. Since then he had
seemingly vanished off the face of the earth. The
Bey’s myrmidons told how they had searched the
Tower, and found that the Giaour had climbed into
its interior. He had used the chisel and displaced a
stone, apparently without object. But the place was
now quite empty, though some one had ground corn
and millet recently in an upper chamber.</p>

<p>Now, the Bey knew quite well that the Blue Man of
El Hamra made the Tower his headquarters when he
visited Rabat periodically to collect subscriptions for
the Jehad that was to drive every foreigner out of the
sacred land of the Moors. But he kept silent on that
matter, for he feared the Blue Man even more than
the British Fleet. Nevertheless, he caused inquiries
to be made, though no one had met the tinted prophet
of late.</p>

<p>In a country where there are no roads, nor any actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
government beyond the sphere of each chief town,
official zeal does not travel far. The <i>Water Witch</i>
sailed to Cape Coast Castle, and reported the disappearance
of Mr. “Alfred Williams” to an officer who
came out to meet her in the Governor’s own surf&ndash;boat.
A cruiser hastened to Rabat, and trained a gun on the
principal palace, whereupon the Bey went aboard in
person to explain that none could have made more
genuine effort than he to find the lost Nazarene, either
dead or alive. And perforce he was believed. Even
the British Vice&ndash;Consul could not charge him with
negligence, though not one word had he said to any
European concerning the Blue Man of El Hamra.</p>

<p>The cruiser flitted back to Cape Coast Castle, and
thence to Lagos, and there was much wonderment in
the small circle that knew the truth. Yet no man is
indispensable, whether in West Africa or London, and
another Deputy Commissioner was gazetted for the
special duty of dealing with native unrest in the Benuë
River district. The facts were communicated to
Whitehall, and an official from the Colonial Office
called on an Under Secretary in the Foreign Office to
explain why Captain Forbes was acting in the capacity
for which Captain Arthur Warden seemed to be so
peculiarly fitted.</p>

<p>“It is a queer business,” said the Under Secretary.
“What do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“I believe he was worried about a woman,” began
the other.</p>

<p>“What? In Rabat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“No, no, in London. Only this morning I received
a letter from a Mrs. Laing, who says she is exceedingly
anxious to ascertain Captain Warden’s address. Now,
Lady Hilbury wrote two days ago with the same object,
and, of course, I returned a polite message to the effect
that he was engaged on Government service.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Laing!” mused the Under Secretary. He
unlocked a diary, and ran back through its pages. “I
thought I remembered the name,” he continued. “She
was staying with the Baumgartners at Lochmerig before
they went to Hamburg in their yacht.”</p>

<p>He was silent for a few seconds. His nails seemed
to need instant examination. Apparently satisfied by
the scrutiny, he went on:</p>

<p>“I rather liked that youngster. He struck me as
the sort of man who would go far. Have you replied
to Mrs. Laing?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then please ask her to come here next Tuesday
about three o’clock. Just quote her letter, and allow
it to be assumed that her inquiry concerning Captain
Warden may be answered. I hope you don’t mind
my stepping in in a matter affecting your Department?”</p>

<p>The Colonial man laughed.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” he said, “I have a whole regiment
of lady visitors and correspondents whom I shall gladly
hand over to you.”</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Rosamund’s furs and frills
graced the same chair in the Foreign Office that Warden
had sat in when he interviewed the Under Secretary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
She was charmingly anxious in manner. Though of
high rank in the Government, the Under Secretary was
young enough to be impressionable; he was clearly a
dandy; such men are the easiest to subjugate.</p>

<p>“In the first place, Mrs. Laing,” he said, when she
explained her earnest wish to communicate at once
with Captain Warden, “you will not misunderstand
me if I ask what measure of urgency lies behind your
business with him. We officials, you know, like to
wrap ourselves in a cloak of mystery with red tape
trimmings. Yet I promise you I shall match your
candor if possible.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;perhaps I ought to begin by saying that&mdash;if
not exactly engaged&mdash;Captain Warden and I are
very dear to each other. We were engaged once, years
ago. But I was young. I was forced into marriage
with another, who is now dead.”</p>

<p>Rosamund made this ingenuous confession with the
necessary hesitancy and downward eye&ndash;glances. The
Under Secretary was sympathetic, and delighted, and
envious of Captain Warden’s good fortune. There
could be no doubt about these things, because he said
them.</p>

<p>“That being so, I know a good deal of his private
affairs,” said Rosamund demurely. “I knew, for
instance, that he might be summoned to West Africa
at any moment, but he is such a scrupulously precise
man where duty is concerned that he would actually
go away without telling me anything about it if ordered
not to take any one into his confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Something of the kind has happened,” admitted
the Under Secretary.</p>

<p>“Ah, then, he really is in Africa, and if I write&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, but I fear I have misled you. He is
not in Nigeria. When last I heard of him he was at
Rabat.”</p>

<p>“Where is that?” she cried, genuinely surprised.</p>

<p>“On the West Coast of Morocco.”</p>

<p>“But what is he doing there?”</p>

<p>The Under Secretary pressed the tips of his fingers
closely together.</p>

<p>“It is difficult to say,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Surely you will tell me. I have a right to know,”
she pleaded. “I understand the position on the Benuë
River. I am the daughter of a West African Governor.
I am one of the few women in England who can grasp
the seriousness of any plot which brings together the
men of Oku and the trusted confidant of a meddlesome
foreign potentate. Captain Warden was sent to the
Protectorate to carry out your instructions, and that is
the very reason I wish to write to him. I have news
of the utmost importance.”</p>

<p>“Connected with the sailing of the <i>Sans Souci</i> from
Hamburg?”</p>

<p>The question was so unexpected that Rosamund
looked at the Under Secretary with more shrewdness
than her fine eyes had displayed hitherto. He was
making a little circle of dots with a pencil on a blotting&ndash;pad.
Neither by voice nor manner did he display any
surprise at her reference to the men of Oku.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, that is one of the items,” she said.</p>

<p>“And the others?”</p>

<p>“But you are telling me nothing,” she pouted.</p>

<p>“Forgive me. I hate the necessity that imposes
restraint. Now, Mrs. Laing, enlighten me on one
point, and I shall acquaint you with such few details
of Captain Warden’s recent movements as are in my
possession. What interest had he in Rabat?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;really&mdash;don’t know.”</p>

<p>The protest was honest. This fashionable lady was
speaking the truth.</p>

<p>“Who, in your opinion, might know?” he persisted.</p>

<p>Rosamund was not prepared for that. Her mind
flew instantly to Evelyn Dane. Of course she would
not mention the girl’s name; the mere thought of
Evelyn cast a shadow over her mobile face.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the faintest notion,” she said.</p>

<p>The accompanying smile was forced, and the Under
Secretary was not in the least deceived.</p>

<p>“Of course, if you cannot tell me why Captain
Warden should go ashore at Rabat no one can, I suppose,”
and Rosamund caught the pleasing hint of her
dominance in all that affected the man she loved.</p>

<p>“You keep on referring to this place that I have
never before heard of,” she cried. “Is he still at
Rabat? I have ascertained that he is not at Lagos, or
in Southern Nigeria, because I cabled for information.”</p>

<p>“When last I heard of Captain Warden he was at
Rabat,” said the Under Secretary. “He is not there
now. Indeed, I cannot tell you where he is. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
earth had opened and swallowed him, he could not
have disappeared more completely.”</p>

<p>Rosamund gasped, and was somewhat inclined to
storm, but not another syllable would the Under Secretary
add to his amazing statement, though he undertook
to communicate with her immediately when news
of Warden’s whereabouts reached him. In the meantime,
she had to be content with knowledge that was
no knowledge, and that only added to her perplexity.
On the way to the hotel she stopped her carriage at a
map&ndash;seller’s and bought a map of Morocco, and a
book which revealed many things about Rabat, but
no one thing calculated to explain why Warden had
gone there.</p>

<p>In some sense, the Under Secretary was more puzzled
than Rosamund. He turned to his notes and
pored over them. One paragraph stood out boldly.</p>

<p>“Captain Warden, when at Cowes, met a young
lady, Miss Evelyn Dane, engaged as companion to
Baumgartner’s daughter. He took her in a dinghy
to the <i>Sans Souci</i>, and this slight chance led to the
discovery that the yacht was in charge of a shore
watchman.”</p>

<p>The Under Secretary actually rumpled his hair with
those immaculate fingers of his.</p>

<p>“I am lost in a fog,” he confessed ruefully. “Mrs.
Laing is <i>not</i> engaged to Warden&mdash;Lady Hilbury
herself told me so only this morning. Warden is the
last man alive to discuss Government affairs with Mrs.
Laing or any other woman. Why, then, does she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
pretend that he did the very thing he did not do? And
who is this girl, Evelyn Dane, to whom he telegraphed
from Ostend and London before sailing in the <i>Water
Witch</i>? Can <i>she</i> shed light on the dark places of
Rabat? It is worth trying. The <i>Sans Souci</i> arrives
at Madeira to&ndash;morrow. I shall instruct some one to
call on Evelyn Dane, and find out how far she is mixed
up in the wretched muddle. Confound Rabat, and
the Benuë, and the men of Oku, and may Baumgartner
be blistered! I shall not get a day’s hunting before the
frost sets in.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pc1">THE BLUE MAN&mdash;AND A WHITE</p>

<p class="p2">When Warden came to his senses he found himself
lying in impenetrable darkness. A half&ndash;formed belief
that he was blind impelled him to put his hands to
his face. Then he awoke to realities. His wrists
were bound tightly, movement was painful and almost
impossible, yet he seemed to be strapped to something
that moved. By using his eyelids he soon succeeded
in convincing himself that his eyes were uninjured,
but the cold sweat of fear induced by that first horrible
suspicion revived him more speedily than any stimulant.
Straining his cramped limbs to test both his
bonds and his injuries, he was not long in reaching a
fairly accurate estimate of a disastrous plight. His
head and left shoulder were stiff and sore, and he
believed he had been rendered unconscious by a blow
that caused a slight concussion of the brain. There
was a bitter taste in his mouth which he recognized as
poppy&ndash;juice, a preparation of opium widely used in
Northern Africa as a soothing tonic. This, in itself,
was somewhat reassuring. It suggested a crude effort
to revive him. Again, though tied hand and foot,
he was lying comfortably, and the irregular swaying
motion which puzzled his waking thoughts was quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
explained by the shuffling of sandals and the occasional
grunting comments of the men who carried the palanquin,
or litter, in which he was pent.</p>

<p>But how account for the darkness? Turn and twist
as he would, there was no glimmer of light, and the
most closely&ndash;woven fabric that ever left a loom could
not altogether shut out the rays of the tropical sun
rising over Morocco when last he saw its beams. Then
a gust of cool air blew in on his clammy cheek through
a slit in the litter&ndash;cloth, and the astounding knowledge
that it was already night was forced on him. Now,
he was almost certain that he suffered from no injury
grave enough to entail fifteen or twenty hours of complete
insensibility, and the only reasonable conclusion
was that he had been drugged.</p>

<p>That was a displeasing explanation of the taste of
poppy&ndash;juice, but he felt too sick and weary to care very
much what strange hazard had brought him to his
present state. It sufficed that he was a captive, that
the <i>Water Witch</i> would sail without him, that he would
be discredited in his service for missing an appointment
of the utmost importance. These ills were
obvious. No matter what other misfortunes the immediate
future might have in store, his visit to Hassan’s
Tower had proved unlucky in all save its direct object,
the recovery of the ruby.</p>

<p>Perhaps even that slight recompense for these positive
evils had been taken from him. His revolver was
gone, and the chisel, as he could determine by rolling
a little from side to side. Probably his pockets were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
emptied long since. He tried to raise his body ever so
slightly, but failed, yet he fancied he could feel the
pressure of the ring against his ribs. And in fact it
was still in his possession, for those who had robbed
him, though they unfastened his waistcoat to learn if
he wore a money&ndash;belt, had missed the hidden pocket.
He was deadly tired. The nauseating drug with which
he had been dosed was still powerful enough to render
him almost incapable of reasoned thought. After the
effects of the first thrill of restored vitality had passed,
he listened idly to the pattering feet and muttered talk
of his bearers. Then he resigned himself to fate, and
fell asleep.</p>

<p>When next he awoke he was still in the palanquin.
But the curtains were drawn apart, it was daylight,
and a Moor was unfastening his bonds. The man
spoke to him in a jargon that was incomprehensible.
Warden sat up. He felt cold and stiff, and a twinge
of pain in his shoulder drew from him a stifled exclamation
in English.</p>

<p>The Moor spoke again. This time it was dimly
discernible that he was asking in execrable French if
Monsieur wished to eat and drink.</p>

<p>Warden answered him in the same language.</p>

<p>“Why am I here?” he said, glancing round a rough
camp pitched in the shade of a grove of tall trees.</p>

<p>“You must address the ever&ndash;to&ndash;be&ndash;honored Nila
Moullah.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I am only a servant,” was the reply.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am not French,” began Warden, “I am an Englishman.”</p>

<p>The man growled an oath in Arabic, and repeated
the request about food. It was useless to question
him.</p>

<p>“What is on the menu?” said Warden, with a wry
smile.</p>

<p>He was not to be starved, it seemed. Perhaps
some explanation of his present predicament would
soon be forthcoming. At any rate, his wits would be
clearer after a meal. He had eaten nothing during
twenty&ndash;four hours at the lowest reckoning. He saw
now that a new day was well advanced. The trees
opposed a dense screen to the sun, but that luminary
was high in the heavens, and he was sure he had not
dreamed of the night journey in the palanquin. A
dozen Moors, all armed to the teeth, lolled on the grass
or sat on the gnarled roots of trees in the glade that
sheltered the bivouac. At some little distance there
was a palanquin similar to his own, save that its trappings
were more gaudy, and the bearer&ndash;poles were
painted a bright blue. The curtains were closed, but
the color of the paint, added to the title of the moullah
to whom the Moor referred him for information,
accentuated a notion slowly taking shape in his brain.
He had not forgotten the extraordinary being who
gazed at him so threateningly from the top of the tower.
It was a fair assumption that the man had dropped a
stone on him at the very instant he took the downward
leap that would have secured his safety. Was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
he a prisoner in the hands of this fanatic? And for
what purpose was he brought into the interior?</p>

<p>That he was far away from the coast was determined
by many signs. The keen, invigorating mountain
air, the hardy types of trees and shrubs, the
absence of the myriads of insects that would have
made a grove on the plains a place of anything but
rest at that hour&mdash;these things were an open book
to one accustomed to life in the jungle. He reflected
bitterly that if he had practised the first rudiments of
the scout’s art the previous day, he would now, in all
likelihood, be on board the steamer. Then he remembered
the ring, and pressed a hand to his breast
while ostensibly rubbing his injured shoulder. Yes,
it was there&mdash;the one article left him. Watch,
money, revolver, even a handkerchief and a box of
matches, were stolen, but the ring remained. He
wondered dully how the Blue Priest would have
accounted for the piece of tattooed skin&mdash;with its
Arabic&ndash;Latin quotation from the Epistle of St. Paul
to the Hebrews and its Portuguese announcement of
the secret hoard of Hassan’s Tower&mdash;if it had happened
to be in his pocket. But it reposed in a portmanteau
in his cabin, together with the canvas bag
containing the gourd. When he was missed, would
the skipper examine his baggage to discover some clue
to his identity? If so, that weather&ndash;beaten tar’s
remarks when he looked at the face of M’Wanga, one&ndash;time
king of Benin, would be interesting.</p>

<p>The Moor came back with a dish of pillau, chicken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
stewed with rice. It was exceedingly appetizing.
Some coarse bread and a bowl of goat’s milk completed
a meal that was almost sumptuous. He ate heartily,
and his spirits rose with each mouthful. The nondescript
warriors who formed his escort paid little heed
to him, even when he rose and stretched his limbs in a
stroll round the palanquin. A man unacquainted
with native ways might have drawn a favorable augury
from their indifference&mdash;not so Warden, to whom
it gave sure proof that his escape was deemed impossible.</p>

<p>At a little distance was a larger gathering, mainly
servants and coolies. Here, too, were tethered some
camels and hill ponies. The strength and equipment
of the party betokened a much more serious purpose
than the capture of a stray European; yet he seemed
to be the only prisoner; the others were Moors, Arabs,
and negroes, the soldiers and hangers&ndash;on of a fighting
caravan.</p>

<p>A croaking voice from behind the curtains of the
gaily caparisoned palanquin suddenly brought the
armed Moors to their feet. One of them, who spoke
good French, bade Warden come nearer, the litter&ndash;cloth
was thrust aside, and the blue man of the Hassan
Tower was revealed. Huddled up at the back of the
cramped conveyance, he looked more like a strange
beast than a man. If his appearance was forbidding
when seen in Warden’s upward glance from the base
of the tower, it was positively repulsive at this nearer
and more leisurely point of view. The dye applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to skin and hair gave him a grotesque, almost maniacal
aspect. His elfin locks were matted. His face and
limbs had a peculiarly dead aspect, since the blue pigment
had dried in dull scales that counterfeited the
leathery surface of a mummy’s body. The sunken
black eyes, gleaming out of bloodshot sockets, alone
told of life. He reminded Warden of some cannibal
ju&ndash;ju man from the trackless swamps of Nigeria.
That such a loathsome creature should command the
fearful respect of several distinguished&ndash;looking Mohammedans
would be inconceivable were it not for
the hush that fell on them when they heard his voice,
and the alacrity with which they obeyed his order to
produce the Giaour.</p>

<p>Now, the singular fact that the two men who had
spoken to him used the French language was not lost
on Warden. It argued that they and their companions
hailed from the Sahara border rather than the coast.
If that were so, his capture was a fantastic mistake.
They could have no possible grievance against him.
A germ of hope sprang up in his heart, but the Nila
Moullah soon destroyed it.</p>

<p>“Bid the Frank do homage,” he grunted in Arabic.</p>

<p>“Kneel!” said the interpreter.</p>

<p>“I am rather stiff in the joints,” said Warden, speaking
composedly, “but I shall be glad to sit down and
talk with the distinguished moullah if that is agreeable
to him.”</p>

<p>He squatted on the ground, but two men seized him
roughly and tried to force him to his knees. He resisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
with a mad fury that was more creditable to his
pluck than to his intelligence&mdash;yet there are indignities
that cannot be borne, and this was one. Though
handicapped by a crippled shoulder and the enervating
effect of the drug, though he was grappled with
before he could rise&mdash;and the Moors were men of
bone and sinew&mdash;he fought so fiercely that both of his
assailants were prostrate at the same time as himself.
A coward’s blow ended the unequal tussle. A heavy
whip cut him ferociously across the eyes, and half&ndash;blinded
him, and he was flung violently face downward
in front of the Blue Man, who muttered:</p>

<p>“Let the Kaffir dog lie there till he learns obedience.”</p>

<p>Thinking he was subdued, the Moors relaxed their
grip. Then Warden sprang to his feet. If death were
at hand, in dying he would at least rid tortured humanity
of an oppressor. But the Nila Moullah seemed
to guess his thought, and shrieked to his guards that
they should hold fast the Nazarene. They pinioned
his arms again, and the French&ndash;speaking Moor asked
him why he had dared to disturb a place made holy
by the presence of the moullah.</p>

<p>Nearly incoherent with pain and anger, Warden
managed to answer that he had done harm to none,
that he was not even a resident in Rabat, having
landed at the port little more than an hour before he
visited the Tower.</p>

<p>“Ah, he is not one of the accursed brood at Rabat?
So much the better! They will fall like ripe pears at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the time of plucking,” snarled the occupant of the
litter.</p>

<p>Since the words were Arabic, Warden understood,
but the instinct of self&ndash;preservation bade him conceal
the fact. Nevertheless, he forced his lips to utter a
dignified protest.</p>

<p>“I am an Englishman,” he said, “and my disappearance
will be reported. Inquiry will be made&mdash;it
is known that I went to the Hassan Tower&mdash;and
your large caravan cannot travel without exciting
comment. You will certainly be pursued and attacked,
whether I am living or dead. Yet I am not vindictive.
Set me free, bring me back to Rabat in time to join
my ship, and I shall lodge no complaint against you,
nor claim my money and other belongings.”</p>

<p>“What sayeth the unbeliever?” demanded the
moullah.</p>

<p>He was told, with fair accuracy, and seemed to find
humor in Warden’s words.</p>

<p>“Slaves do not parley with their masters,” he announced,
grinning vindictively at his captive. “Tie
him in the litter. If he speaks, gag him. To&ndash;morrow
he can carry a load with the rest.”</p>

<p>It needed all of Warden’s philosophy to keep him
from going mad during that dreadful journey across
Morocco. The Nila Moullah’s orders were literally
obeyed. After the second day’s march, when sixty
miles of hilly country intervened between Rabat and
the caravan, the Englishman was deprived of his
palanquin and became a beast of burden. Still, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
lived, and was fed, and he prayed that he might retain
his reason. The belief that he knew no Arabic enabled
him to gather some scraps of information. The
Blue Priest of El Hamra was preaching a new jehad,
but, unlike others of his kidney, he was a born organizer.
Instead of stirring up a minor rebellion
which would be snuffed out either by the Sultan of
Morocco or by one of the European powers, he was
gradually making himself known throughout the
length and breadth of the land. In his own stronghold
of Lektawa, on the very confines of the Great
Desert, he was building up an army of fanatics.
Meanwhile, his repute was such that he levied heavy
contributions in money and kind on the more fertile
seaboard provinces. When the time was propitious
he would descend on Morocco, enslave or kill every
Christian, loot every port, and establish himself another
Mahomet. Till then, he was content to pose
as a saint.</p>

<p>Such a programme is nothing new in the Mussulman
world. Since the inspired camel&ndash;driver of Mecca
was rapt half&ndash;way to Paradise in his coffin, nearly
five hundred mahdis have each and all claimed to be
the one, true, and much&ndash;predicted “holy man” destined
to lead Islam to complete victory over Christendom.</p>

<p>These impostors are infinitely worse than a pestilence.
They resemble it in their unexpected outbursts
and phenomenal areas of activity, but they scourge
Moslemin mankind with a virulence unknown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
cholera or small&ndash;pox. It was Warden’s grievous misfortune
that he had blundered into Hassan’s Tower
while the Blue Man of El Hamra was meditating an
attack on the purse of the faithful of Rabat, and the
chance thus offered of securing a Christian captive to
grace the prophet’s return to Lektawa was too tempting
to be neglected.</p>

<p>Fate oft chooses her victims with savage recklessness,
but Warden felt, as he crossed the Atlas Mountains
by way of the Beni Musa pass, that some
influence more far&ndash;seeing than fate was leading him
along the path trodden by Domenico Garcia after the
ruby was hidden in the tower. He had no manner of
doubt that the Portuguese artist and pirate was taken
into the heart of Africa by this very route. The belief
sustained him in those too frequent moments when
sheer weariness of spirit whispered of self&ndash;destruction.
He refused to end his sufferings in that way. If rabid
fanaticism could sway a whole Mohammedan race, he,
at least, placed his trust in a higher and holier creed.
Not till grim death bade him lay down his arms would
he abandon the struggle. Never a day passed that he
did not plan a means of escape, but every scheme
promised failure, and he did not mean to fail, for
failure meant death. So he trudged on manfully, his
only friend a stalwart negro who spoke the Hausa
language, and ever the road led to the southeast&mdash;to
the desert&mdash;to the great unknown land.</p>

<p>His boots gave out; his clothes were torn to rags; he
was compelled to adopt the garments and many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
habits of those with whom his lot was cast. But he
kept the ruby safe, for none thought of searching him
now, and he was given a certain measure of liberty
once the Atlas range was passed. Towns and villages
became more scattered. The country was so wild that
any attempt to travel by other road than the long&ndash;established
caravan track would mean easy re&ndash;capture.
To go back was equally impossible. Every
community in the Nila Moullah’s own territory was
gratified by the spectacle of a Giaour among the
Mahdi’s train. The people would crowd round him,
and jeer at him, for no better cause than that he was
one of the hated white race. Many of them had never
before seen a white man, but that did not count&mdash;they
cursed him roundly for the sake of the legends
they had heard of the arrogance with which the
Prophet’s followers were treated by Nazarenes in their
own lands.</p>

<p>Warden bore this contumely with infinite patience.
He knew that the desert folk were repaying some of
the wrongs their ancestors had endured from generations
of Portuguese and Spanish freebooters. But at
least he laid to heart the knowledge that he could never
return by the way he had come unless he were still a
slave. He would be recognized instantly, and clubbed
to death like a mad dog.</p>

<p>Despite his hardships, he was soon restored to perfect
health. The winter season, such as it is in the
Sahara, was approaching. The air was invigorating,
and the rough food, mainly grains and fruit, was wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and nutritious. Yet, when Lektawa was reached,
his case looked desperate indeed. Day followed day,
and week followed week, without any prospect of
relief, and he became more and more a mere appanage
of the Nila Moullah’s household. It was just when
hope itself was yielding to numb despair that the
sought&ndash;for opportunity presented itself. It came like
a meteor falling from the midnight sky, and Warden,
ever on the watch, was ready to avail himself of the
light it shed on his dark calvary.</p>

<p>Some Mohammedan festival had led to a good deal
of revelry and gormandizing when Warden, at the close
of a tiring day, found his negro friend sitting at the
door of his hut in an attitude of deep dejection.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” he asked.</p>

<p>The man, moved by the familiar accents of his native
tongue, gave way to tears. His plaint was common
enough in communities ruled by a truculent savage
of the moullah’s type. His daughter, a finely&ndash;built
girl of fifteen, had been spoken of by some parasite,
and she was summoned forthwith to the despot’s
seraglio. Now, the negro, who belonged to one of
the numerous Hausa tribes, while ready enough to
enlist under the prophet’s banner, was far from gratified
by the prospect of becoming his holiness’ father&ndash;in&ndash;law.
A doubtful privilege at the best, it was shared
by many, and a goodly number had been beheaded to
prevent further unpleasantness when the lady failed
to recognize the moullah’s attractiveness as a husband.
Moreover, the Hausa girl herself rebelled against her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
lot, and was nearly wild with terror at the thought of
it. Warden could hear her sobbing inside the hut,
while her father muttered his anger to one whom he
knew instinctively he might trust.</p>

<p>Somehow, Warden felt that his chance had come.
He dared all in the next instant.</p>

<p>“Were in I your place,” he said, “that dog should
never claim my daughter. I would kill him first.”</p>

<p>The Hausa shivered with anxiety. What would be
his fate if others were aware that he even listened to
those bold words without denouncing the man who
uttered them.</p>

<p>“You know him not, Seyyid,” he said, and the fact
that he used the word for “master” to a slave showed
how deeply he was stirred. “He is invulnerable and
far&ndash;seeing. He reads men’s thoughts; he can kill with
a look. Even you, a Nazarene, could not resist him.”</p>

<p>“That is what he tells the fools who choose to believe
him. I was made a prisoner because a stone
struck me insensible. If he is so powerful, why did he
hide me in a litter until he was far from Rabat? Now
attend to me, Beni Kalli. I shall save you and your
daughter if you do exactly as I bid you.”</p>

<p>The man raised his eyes. Here was a new tone in
the Christian who had endured insult and blows with
meekness, except on that solitary occasion when the
Blue Priest ordered him to kneel before him.</p>

<p>“Speak, Seyyid. At least I shall not betray you,”
he muttered.</p>

<p>“You must get me some Arab clothing which I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
put on in your hut when it is dark. Then I shall take
your daughter to the moullah’s house. At that hour
he will be alone in an inner room, and the fact that I
bring the girl will procure me admission&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you will be discovered at once. How should
a man be an Arab who speaks no Arabic?”</p>

<p>“Do I not?” laughed Warden, going off instantly
into the sonorous language of the desert. “I can
accomplish that and more, Beni Kalli, if you follow
my plan.”</p>

<p>The Hausa sprang to his feet in amazement.</p>

<p>“Master!” he cried, “you know Arabic better than
I, who have lived here many years.”</p>

<p>He thought the Nazarene was a wizard. Thenceforth
he was ready to fall in with any proposal he
made.</p>

<p>Warden’s scheme was feasible. Beni Kalli, afraid
to be skeptical, yet only half convinced at first, quickly
saw that its very daring commended it. Moreover,
time pressed. He must either sacrifice his daughter
or adopt some such heroic alternative as that suggested
by one whom he already recognized as a leader of men.
Immediate decision was called for. To defy the Nila
Moullah’s will meant simply that the malcontent
would be beheaded forthwith.</p>

<p>“I am between the lion and his prey,” said Beni
Kalli valiantly. “So I face the lion. Have it as you
will, Seyyid. I am at your command.”</p>

<p>His proverb was well chosen. Never did people in
dire straits adopt bolder strategy than that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Warden had in mind. He had often weighed it and
found it practicable, but hitherto it had proved impossible
owing to the secrecy with which the prophet
surrounded his daily life. When traveling, the Blue
Man usually remained in his litter. At Lektawa he
gave audience unseen. None could gain admission
to his compound without stating their business and
revealing their identity; he lived alone and hidden,
like a spider in the dark recesses of his murderous
web. Now that safeguard, previously unsurmountable,
vanished by reason of the girl’s presence. For
the rest, Warden relied not only on his own audacity,
but on the assured cowardliness of a crafty tyrant.</p>

<p>There is an hour in the desert&mdash;the hour following
sunset&mdash;when night wraps the earth in blackness as
in a pall. It is due to the rapid fall in temperature
and the resultant condensation of surface moisture
taken up by the air. But it soon passes. If there is a
moon, the landscape becomes a radiant etching in
black and silver; even when the moon is absent, the
light of the stars makes traveling safe. Therefore,
the time at Warden’s disposal was limited. So many
shrewd eyes watched the Nila Moullah’s dwelling that
if success were to attend the <i>coup</i> it must be carried
out during the forty minutes of darkness.</p>

<p>And there was much to be done in that brief period.
As soon as the rapidly advancing gloom permitted,
Warden and the girl crossed the open space in the
center of which stood the moullah’s abode. The
Englishman was so bronzed by exposure to the elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
that the hood of a burnous was scarcely needed
to conceal his face. The young negress, a comely
statue of ebony draped in white cotton, was so terror&ndash;stricken
that she offered the most serious obstacle to
Warden’s project. But that could not be helped. He
depended on her to draw those ferret eyes off himself
for the one precious moment he needed. After that,
he trusted utterly to his own resources.</p>

<p>There was no trouble at the entrance to the compound.
The guards were Moors recruited from the
seaboard provinces, well&ndash;paid hirelings whom the Blue
Man could safely order to kill any obnoxious members
of his own tribe. Were they Arabs, they might have
suspected Warden’s accent, but the patois they used
was almost unintelligible among the desert folk. So
Warden spoke with a harsh distinctness.</p>

<p>“Go, one of you,” he said, “and tell the glorious
successor of the Prophet that the daughter of Beni
Kalli awaits his pleasure.”</p>

<p>The chief man among the guards came forward
and peered at them. His glance fell on the shrinking
form by the side of this stalwart Bedâwi.</p>

<p>“’Tis well,” he said. “Even now the Holy One
asked why she tarried. Who art thou, brother?”</p>

<p>“What, then, must the renowned son of Mahmoud
suffer further delay?” cried Warden, even more loudly.</p>

<p>He risked a good deal, because some true Arab
might be within earshot, and there are gutturals in
the nomadic language of Northern Africa that no
European throat can reproduce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>But his fearlessness was justified. A snarling voice
reached them where they stood.</p>

<p>“Bring the girl hither,” it growled, and the two were
allowed to pass instantly.</p>

<p>Warden’s heart throbbed a little faster as he half
dragged the cowering negress across the courtyard.
She knew what was going to happen, and had been
coached as to her behavior, but she was only a child, and
her fear was great for her father and herself. She could
not believe that this gaunt Christian, the man whom
she had seen working daily among the Nila Moullah’s
slaves, could really accomplish the task he had undertaken.
So she whimpered with fright, and would
have run back shrieking if Warden had not caught her
arm and whispered a few words of encouragement.</p>

<p>The prophet’s habit of concealing himself as much
as possible from his adherents was now more helpful
than a hundred armed men. He was supposed to
pass day and night in meditation. None had ever
seen him eat or sleep. To carry out this pose he
seldom appeared from behind the thick mats which
veiled the front of the room he occupied.</p>

<p>A lamp was burning within. When Warden lifted
a corner of one of the mats, he saw a grotesque and
ghoulish&ndash;looking figure seated cross&ndash;legged on a praying&ndash;carpet.
Two red&ndash;rimmed, glittering black eyes
gazed fixedly at him, and a hand sought under a cushion
for a weapon, since none dared to pass that screen
without direct instructions. Warden turned quickly,
and pushed the girl forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Beni Kalli was slow in fulfilling your wishes, O
worthy of honor,” he exclaimed, bowing low yet
advancing the while, and never relaxing his grip on
the unhappy negress. Her manifest reluctance explained
his action. The Blue Man appreciated the
rough ways of an Arab.</p>

<p>“There are means to make him speedy,” he chuckled,
rising.</p>

<p>That was what Warden wanted. In raising himself,
the moullah was momentarily off his guard. In
the next instant he was lying with his face on the floor;
a strong hand was across his mouth pulling his head
back until his neck was almost dislocated, while the
blade of a sharp knife rested most suggestively across
his throat.</p>

<p>“Turn the lamp low,” said Warden to the girl.
His voice was quiet and reassuring, but she was so
completely unnerved that she nearly put out the light,
which would have been awkward. Happily, she
avoided that blunder.</p>

<p>“Now listen, you dog!” muttered Warden, slightly
relieving the tension on the Blue Man’s spinal column.
“Do as I bid, and I shall spare your life. Say but a
word, utter the least cry, save as I direct, and your
head will leave your miserable body. Do you understand,
<i>sug</i>?”</p>

<p>He used the concluding epithet purposely. It is
more opprobrious in Arabic than its English equivalent
“cur.” It showed how fully he was the victor in
this unexpected strife, and he emphasized the warning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
with a more decided pressure of the sharp blade in
the region of the jugular vein. The moullah could not
have been more at his mercy were he manacled. He
was flat on the ground, sprawling with arms and legs
like some ugly frog, and Warden’s right knee was
jammed in the small of his back. There was naught
to be done but yield, and, when permitted to speak, he
murmured humbly that he would obey.</p>

<p>“Say ‘Seyyid,’ you swine!” said the Englishman.</p>

<p>“Seyyid!” gurgled the other.</p>

<p>“Pay heed, then,” continued Warden, with a grim
earnestness that left no doubt in his hearer’s mind that
he would not hesitate to slit a throat if need be. “The
least alteration of my commands shall forfeit thy life.
Call the leader of the guard, and tell him to summon
hither Beni Kalli, who is to be admitted alone and
without question. Tell him also to bring into the
compound the three best camels you possess, with store
of food and water for a journey. Beni Kalli is to come
at once, and the camels are to be ready within ten
minutes. Shout now&mdash;he will hear thee.”</p>

<p>Thus far, the conditions did not sound onerous,
and the Blue Man complied with them to the fraction
of a syllable. An anxious, heart&ndash;searching five minutes
followed. Warden did not fail to impress on the
quaking wretch in his grasp that he was receiving more
clemency than he deserved, and warned him sternly
against ever again treating a European with contumely.
He could feel the thrill of mortal terror that shook the
moullah when he learnt the identity of his assailant.</p>

<p>It was good that the tyrant should know what fear
was, yet the time passed with leaden feet until Beni
Kalli, more than doubting that the Seyyid’s scheme
had failed, lifted a mat and thrust an awestricken
countenance within. The girl uttered a cry of relief
at the sight of her father, but Warden silenced her
with a word.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill229" id="ill229">ill229</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-229.jpg" width="400" height="630"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">He could feel the thrill of terror that shook the moullah</p>
<p class="captr"><i>Page</i> <a href="#Page_212">212</a></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>He nodded to the Hausa, who immediately began to
tie the moullah’s legs and arms with leather thongs,
using the wholly baffling slave&ndash;knot, which must be
cut ere its victim can be freed. Soon the whining plaint
of camels roused from their accustomed sleeping&ndash;place
was audible. The animals were led into the courtyard,
and their attendants received the dreaded moullah’s
exceedingly curt order that they were to be
handed over to Beni Kalli, his daughter, and the
Arab, Abdul ben Izzuf, for a journey which they were
taking on his business.</p>

<p>And that was the last word the Blue Man of El
Hamra ever uttered. Warden, it is true, kept his
promise, and left him gagged and bound, unable to
move or utter a cry, but otherwise uninjured. He lay
there all night and all the following day, and his views
concerning Nazarenes must have been most unedifying.
After sunset it occurred to some one that even a prophet
might fall ill. One who was in some sense his confidant
and disciple volunteered to look behind the
screen, when he could obtain no answer to his repeated
requests for an audience. He was greatly shocked at
seeing his revered teacher’s plight. In fact, he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the moullah was dead. Most amazing thing of all,
the famous blue robe had vanished. Its disappearance
suggested that the time was ripe for the advent of a
new prophet, and he proclaimed loudly that the Nila
Moullah had been slain in a combat with the devil.
To make sure, being of decisive habit, he planted a
dagger firmly between the Blue Man’s shoulder&ndash;blades.
Although the corpse was warm when the guards came
running at his outcry, none dared touch the body of
one who had wrestled with Satan. It was evident at
least that the disciple could not have trussed his spiritual
guide so thoroughly in a few seconds, and the theory
of diabolic agency was confirmed thereby.</p>

<p>Affairs became lively in Lektawa for a week or two.
Several would&ndash;be prophets died suddenly before order
was restored and a new régime was firmly established.
It was no man’s affair to discover what had become of
the Nazarene slave or Beni Kalli and his daughter,
so no effort was put forth toward that end. Had the
fugitives known the outcome of their bold deed they
might have spared themselves much anxiety. But that
could not be. They fled along the caravan route that
crosses the Western Sahara, and looked ever for the
dust of a pursuing kafila. The Blue Man of El Hamra
was in their thoughts, waking or dreaming, and many
a league separated them from Lektawa ere their fear
abated and they gave heed to the troubles that lay in
front rather than to the vengeance that might be rushing
on them from the rear.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pc1">EVELYN HAS UNEXPECTED VISITORS</p>

<p class="p2">On a moonlit night in January, Evelyn Dane was
sitting in the veranda of the big English&ndash;looking hotel
which has brought more than a hint of Brighton to the
sea front of Las Palmas, Gran Canaria. A dance was
in progress within, and the jingle of a polka mixed
curiously with the continuous roar of a heavy surf.
But Evelyn was in no mood for dancing. While she
was dressing for dinner that evening the boom of a
gun from the harbor announced the arrival of a foreign
warship. Soon afterward she learned the ship’s name,
and from that moment she was on the tip&ndash;toe of expectation,
for the captain of H. M. second&ndash;class cruiser
<i>Valiant</i> supplied the one remaining link between her
present embittered life and the rose&ndash;colored romance
of a day at Plymouth.</p>

<p>Two months earlier, Captain Mortimer came to her
in Funchal, Madeira, with a message that thrilled her
with hope. The Foreign Office had requested him,
he said, to forward any information she could give
which might help to explain why Captain Warden
should vanish so mysteriously at Rabat.</p>

<p>The inquiry was a private one. She must mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
it to none, but it was deemed so important by the
authorities in Whitehall that the <i>Valiant</i> was sent
specially to Madeira to make it. There was not much
that she could tell him. Her sole knowledge of Rabat
was gleaned from Domenico Garcia’s message. She
remembered the text with sufficient accuracy&mdash;but
what a queer jumble of fact and fable it sounded!
Even she herself, though she had actually seen the
carved gourd bobbing about in the Solent, fancied
now that the tattooed parchment supplied a far&ndash;fetched
excuse for Warden’s disappearance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the sailor’s words had driven some of
the hardness out of her heart. She was beginning to
think that Mrs. Laing’s story was true&mdash;that Warden
was really her rival’s promised husband&mdash;that he had
not dared even to write again when he knew that
Rosamund was at Lockmerig. But when this courtly
officer assured her that Captain Warden had undoubtedly
sailed for West Africa two days after the
<i>Sans Souci</i> quitted the lock, she realized that, in some
respects, her doubts were unwarranted. It was amazing
that her lover had not announced his departure,
but the ways of Governments are strange, and his fall
from grace was by no means so great as she had been
forced to believe. And then her tiny bit of blue sky
was darkened by a new cloud. Although the captain
of the <i>Valiant</i>, out of sheer kindliness, concealed the
sinister outcome of Warden’s visit to the Morocco
town, his very reticence induced anxiety. He was
greatly interested in Garcia’s allusion to Hassan’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Tower, listened carefully to Evelyn’s story of the
gourd, and, before departing, asked her to let him
know at Lagos if she left Madeira. That was all.
She had been eight weeks in Las Palmas without ever
a word of her lover. The gloom in her soul deepened
ever, until the clamor of the cruiser’s salute awoke the
echoes.</p>

<p>Hence, Evelyn was one of the few people in the
capital city of the Canary Islands who could supply a
reason for the presence of the <i>Valiant</i> other than the
need of fresh supplies of a vessel on the West African
station. Nor was she wrong in the assumption that
Captain Mortimer might call on her without delay.
She had been seated not many minutes in the veranda,
and had successfully held at bay only two of the half&ndash;dozen
Spanish officers who wished to dance with her,
when the sailor himself approached, and lifted his cap
with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>“You remember me, Miss Dane?” he began.</p>

<p>“Yes. I knew the <i>Valiant</i> had arrived, and I felt
so sure you would look me up that I have refused all
invitations to the ballroom.”</p>

<p>An expression of surprise flitted across the man’s
frank face. Evidently, he had placed Evelyn in another
and higher category than the flippant young
ladies who dominate the winter society of Madeira
and Gran Canaria. To his thinking, when last he
interviewed her, Warden, the man to whom she was
engaged, was undoubtedly dead. By this time, even
a heedless girl might have suspected the truth, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
was not prepared to find Warden’s sweetheart so
obviously indifferent to his fate as to plunge into all
the gaiety of the Las Palmas season.</p>

<p>He knew nothing of the agony of suspense, the
poison of doubt, the self&ndash;humiliation and passionate
despair of those dreary weeks, nor did he appreciate
her position in the Baumgartner household. But he
was hurt, and his manner proved it. Men who are
called on at times to face death in their country’s
service like to believe that their women&ndash;folk are eager
for news of them. So Mortimer was disappointed in
Evelyn.</p>

<p>“I fear I shall be regarded as an intruder by some
of the young gentlemen I see pirouetting inside,” he
said. “But I shall not detain you long. I promised
to let you know if any further news was forthcoming
as to Captain Warden’s whereabouts. When we met
at Funchal I feared the worst. Now I have good
reason to believe he is alive.”</p>

<p>She leaped to her feet. Her cheeks blanched, but
those blue eyes of hers blazed with sudden fire.</p>

<p>“You have heard of him? You know where he
is?” she gasped, all a&ndash;quiver with excitement.</p>

<p>The sailor was mystified. Nevertheless, her manifest
interest almost brought back the sympathetic note
to his voice&mdash;almost, but not quite, and she was aware
of the altered tone.</p>

<p>“You are asking too much,” he said with a little
laugh. “Africa does not yield her secrets so readily,
I assure you. Still, I have a rather complicated yarn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
for you. Shall we sit here, or would you care for a
stroll in the garden? I take it we are less likely to be
disturbed there.”</p>

<p>Now it was Evelyn’s turn to be puzzled.</p>

<p>It was no disloyalty to the memory of one who once
had been her lover, but the absolute necessity of chaperoning
Beryl Baumgartner during her mother’s indisposition
that made dancing a possibility that night.</p>

<p>“The garden by all means,” she agreed, trying hard
to restrain her agitation. So they walked among the
dusty palms and oleanders, and Captain Mortimer
told her something of the strange doings of the Blue
Man of El Hamra.</p>

<p>When the <i>Valiant</i> paid her second visit to Rabat,
the Bey was inclined to be communicative. As a
matter of fact, the news of the Nila Moullah’s disastrous
fight with the Evil One spread so rapidly that
it reached the seaboard within a fortnight, whereas the
prophet’s journey in the reverse direction took three
weeks. Other items filtered through the Atlas passes,
and finally there came a man who was actually in
Lektawa at the time of the dread combat. He it was
who first gave definite assurance that Warden lived.
When the new ruler of that disturbed city had slain
every individual overtly opposed to him, and the remaining
inhabitants were meditating on the divine
right of kings, it occurred to someone that the Nazarene
and Beni Kalli were missing. A caravan from
Bel Abbas reported that a European in Arab clothing,
accompanied by a Hausa soldier and a negress, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
ridden in there from the north, and was recruiting a
kafila to go on to Taudeni and Timbuktu. The Frank
had plenty of gold&ndash;dust in quills, both he and the
Hausa were well armed, he spoke Arabic like a native,
and claimed to be the special protégé of the Blue Man
of El Hamra, who had carried benevolence to the
point of giving him his own particular wrap of blue
cotton, which was exhibited to the faithful, not so
much for worship, but as a guarantee of good faith.</p>

<p>It was noticed, too, that the knife used by Satan in
destroying the Nila Moullah resembled one that was
wont to hang at the girdle of his successor, so the deduction
was reasonable, provided the deducer were
sufficiently far away from Lektawa, that the flight of
the Christian and his accomplices had something in
common with the moullah’s death and the establishment
of the new régime.</p>

<p>This, and more, the Bey of Rabat discreetly told to
the captain of the warship. It was clear enough, in
some senses, but it left Evelyn greatly bewildered.</p>

<p>“These names of people and places are so much
Greek to me,” she cried. “What is the outcome of it
all? Is Captain Warden marching across Africa?”</p>

<p>Mortimer was prepared for that question. He unfolded
a map, and they pored over it together. Small
as the type was in which many of the towns were shown,
the bright moonlight would have permitted the names
to be read. But that was unnecessary. The sailor
knew exactly where to point while he explained
matters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here is Rabat,” he said, “and here, beyond the
mountain chain, Lektawa. Now, there appears to be
little doubt that Captain Warden was the European
encountered at Bel Abbas, and I am inclined to believe
the north&ndash;bound caravan’s account of his proceedings
there. A long way south, at the very verge of a tremendous
stretch of desert, we come to Timbuktu.
The obvious inference is that he adopted the Sahara
route as safer than the journey across Morocco, and
headed that way in order to reach Nigeria, the place
where his duty lies.”</p>

<p>“Can he do it? Dare I even hope that he will pass
unharmed through thousands of miles of wild country
inhabited only by savages?”</p>

<p>Her voice broke, and the sailor saw that her eyes
were filled with tears. More perplexed than ever, he
tried to dispel her foreboding, though none knew better
than he the perils Warden would have to encounter.</p>

<p>“Steady, Miss Dane,” he said cheerily. “He
jumped the worst fence when he got away from Lektawa
with money and supplies. The fact that he made
Bel Abbas vouches for his ability to take the rest of
the trip, and he will be on the Niger River long before
he reaches the thousand&ndash;mile limit. Once there, he
is practically in British territory. To put it plainly,
two months ago I didn’t think his chance of being alive
amounted to a row of beans, whereas to&ndash;day I am confident
he will pull through.”</p>

<p>“So you did not tell me everything at Funchal?
Are you keeping back the less pleasing facts now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“No. On my honor, I have given you the whole
budget.”</p>

<p>“When will it be known whether or not&mdash;he has&mdash;arrived
in Nigeria?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that depends on so many circumstances. It
is six hundred miles from Bel Abbas to the Niger, and&mdash;there
may be difficulties. May I ask you a personal
question, Miss Dane? Are you Captain Warden’s
fiancée?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I thought so,” sobbed Evelyn.</p>

<p>“You thought so? Didn’t you know?”</p>

<p>There was a moment of tense silence. Then Evelyn
swept the tears from her eyes with a splendid confidence.
The moonbeams spread a silvery riband
across the dark Atlantic toward the horizon. Beyond
that magic path lay Africa, and her heart had bridged
the void ere she answered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said proudly. “I know! Never again
shall doubt find room in my mind. Oh, Captain
Mortimer, if only I might tell you what I have suffered
during these horrible months, when never a word
came from him, and another woman lost no opportunity
of taunting me with the lie that she was his
promised wife!”</p>

<p>“You are speaking of Mrs. Laing, I suppose?”</p>

<p>For an instant Evelyn did not appreciate the significance
of that marvelously accurate guess. Then
she turned and looked at him in wonderment.</p>

<p>“Why do you mention her?” she cried, almost
hysterically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The sailor smiled, though his face showed some
degree of confusion.</p>

<p>“I have done it now, so I may as well make a clean
breast of it. But, mind you, I am revealing official
secrets, so please forget what I am telling you. Mrs.
Laing went to the Foreign Office, and claimed to be
engaged to Warden. For some reason&mdash;perhaps
some one there had seen <i>you</i>&mdash;she was not believed,
and that is why I was sent to you at Funchal. At any
rate, they seem to know all about you in Whitehall.”</p>

<p>“But only yesterday Mrs. Laing pretended that
Arthur&mdash;that Captain Warden had written to her,
saying he was engaged on a secret mission for the
Government.”</p>

<p>“You can take it from me he did nothing of the
sort. Outside the department, no one knew where he
had gone or what he was doing. He even passed under
an alias on board the <i>Water Witch</i>. There&mdash;I didn’t
mean to tell you that. I am but a poor diplomatist, I
fear. And that reminds me: I must hark back to my
errand. Why has Mrs. Laing come here?”</p>

<p>Evelyn lifted her head defiantly. Mortimer had
blundered into the worst possible line of inquiry.</p>

<p>“She has told me repeatedly that she is in Las
Palmas in order to meet Captain Warden when he
returns from the Oku territory.”</p>

<p>The man glanced around to be sure they were not
overheard.</p>

<p>“That, at least, is untrue, because he is not there.
Owing to his absence, another deputy commissioner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
is appointed. I expect Mrs. Laing’s talkativeness does
not extend to her relations with Miguel Figuero?”</p>

<p>“Ah, how I loathe that man! He&mdash;pestered me
with his attentions at Hamburg, and Trouville, and
Arcachon, and Biarritz. He was either on board the
yacht or visited us at each port of call. But it is only
fair to admit,” she added, “that he seemed rather to
avoid Mrs. Laing.”</p>

<p>“I have reason to believe that they are acting in
collusion,” said Mortimer dryly. “How long do you
remain on the island, Miss Dane?”</p>

<p>“There was some talk the other day of our return.”</p>

<p>“What, all of you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Mrs. Baumgartner wishes to pass the spring
in the Riviera, and her husband says he has important
business at Frankfort in February, so he will leave us
at Nice while he attends to it.”</p>

<p>“Do you go in the yacht?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. She is there&mdash;in the harbor.”</p>

<p>“Yes. The <i>Sans Souci</i> does not travel far without
my knowledge. You changed your crew at Hamburg,
I believe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all our Englishmen were sent home. Mr.
Baumgartner said that Germans were cheaper and
more obedient.”</p>

<p>“What was your opinion of the new crew?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t like them at first, as I had to bother my
wits in talking German if I wished to speak to any of
them, but they are a very superior set of men.”</p>

<p>“You carry a good many hands for a small vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes. Even I thought that.”</p>

<p>“Did you ship a large quantity of heavy stores at
Hamburg?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We were in a hotel there five or
six days, and never visited the yacht during that
time.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Miss Dane, if you should be asked why
I called, we are old friends, eh? I hope I may claim
that privilege apart from other considerations?”</p>

<p>“You have been most kind, Captain Mortimer. I
cannot tell you what a load of care you have taken
from me. Now, I must go to the ballroom and see
that none of those romantic Spaniards has run off with
my charge.”</p>

<p>“Who is that?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Beryl Baumgartner. I am her companion, you
know. Though I am only three years older than
Beryl, I am credited with so much more gravity that
her mother trusts her to me absolutely.”</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Laing there?”</p>

<p>“She was dancing with the Commandante when I
came out.”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“I shall probably see you again to&ndash;morrow evening,”
he said. “Some of my officers will be ashore, and I
may be dining here.”</p>

<p>He took his leave with a cordiality that was in marked
contrast to his earlier frigid manner, but Evelyn had
long since forgotten her surprise at his momentary
curtness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The extraordinary tidings of Warden’s adventures
in Morocco absorbed her mind to the exclusion of all
else. She wanted to study a map, to follow his wanderings
in spirit, to weave fantasies about his track
across the desert with all the ardor of reawakened
love. How could she ever have doubted him? She
was brave enough to flout Rosamund Laing’s first
attempt to undermine her trust&mdash;why had she yielded
to the strain during these later days of weary waiting?
She was sure it was not so with her lover. Some time,
quite soon, there would be a letter or a cablegram
announcing his safe arrival at some weirdly named
British station in Northern Nigeria. She must learn
the map of West Africa by heart. Perhaps her friend,
Captain Mortimer, might tell her from what town she
might expect to receive the earliest news.</p>

<p>But Evelyn’s humble light&ndash;heartedness was destined
not to survive the next ten minutes. Looking in at the
ballroom, she saw Beryl waltzing with a Canario
fruit&ndash;grower, a youthful Spaniard of immense wealth
who owned a large part of the island. While crossing
the hall with intent to find the manager, and get the
loan of an atlas, she almost ran into the arms of Lord
Fairholme, who was standing there, talking to Mrs.
Laing.</p>

<p>“By gad, Miss Dane, it’s just like bein’ in Lochmerig,”
he cried. “Here we are again, you know&mdash;the
same old circus. Couldn’t stand the British climate,
so I fled here, per Spanish packet, as the Post Office
says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“I am delighted to see you again,” she began, but
Mrs. Laing broke in breathlessly.</p>

<p>“They’ve just finished that waltz, Lord Fairholme.
Shall we make up a set for the Lancers?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;er&mdash;no,” he said lamely. “You see, I’m
not dancing just now.”</p>

<p>Rosamund flushed with annoyance. Her rudeness
to Evelyn had caused her to forget Fairholme’s bereavement.</p>

<p>“Pray forgive me,” she cried. “How thoughtless I
was! Who was the man you were conversing with so
deeply in the garden, Miss Dane?”</p>

<p>“A friend, an officer on board one of the ships in
the harbor. Are you making a long stay in Las Palmas,
Lord Fairholme?”</p>

<p>The good&ndash;natured little peer was conscious that the
two women were at daggers drawn, and the younger
one could evidently match her senior in contemptuous
indifference.</p>

<p>“Dunno yet,” he grinned. “It depends on how
Mrs. Laing and you treat me. Judgin’ by the giddy
throng in the ballroom, I’m afraid I shall figure again
in the ‘also ran’ class.”</p>

<p>“Miss Dane is free. I can vouch for that,” laughed
Rosamund.</p>

<p>But Evelyn’s answering smile was more genuine.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Laing’s statements are invariably inaccurate
where I am concerned,” she said. “If your matrimonial
choice rests between her and me, Lord Fairholme,
it is only fair that I should tell you I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
promised to marry Captain Arthur Warden, of the
Nigeria Protectorate, when next he returns to England.”</p>

<p>“Captain Arthur Warden!” gasped the earl, who,
despite his habitual air of buffoonery, could remember
some things exceedingly well.</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“Er&mdash;not exactly. I’ve heard his name.”</p>

<p>Rosamund, scarcely prepared for this turning of the
tables, instantly recalled the unpleasant fact that Billy
Thring was by her side in the hall at Lochmerig when
she purloined Evelyn’s letter. He looked at her now
fixedly, as the color in her face rose and fell with telltale
confusion. For once, she was unable to force a
retort. She almost feared that Fairholme would blurt
forth some reference to the letter.</p>

<p>“I was under a different impression,” she managed
to say. “But I am sure our private affairs are not of
vital interest to Lord Fairholme.”</p>

<p>“Where is old I. D. B.?” put in the man, anxious
to restore harmony. “Shootin’ wild duck by moonlight,
eh, what?”</p>

<p>Evelyn resumed her quest of the manager. She had
not failed to notice Rosamund Laing’s unaccountable
embarrassment, but she attributed it to their personal
feud, and imagined that her rival was furiously
annoyed by her outspokenness. It was fortunate, in
some respects, that the incident was fresh in her mind.
She was soon to be enlightened.</p>

<p>She borrowed an atlas, and was studying the ominously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
vague details of the interior of Northwest Africa,
when a maid&ndash;servant came to her room. With some
difficulty, for Evelyn knew very little Spanish, the girl
made her understand that <i>un muchado Ingles</i> wished
to see her. An English boy! Who could it be at that
hour? The few English children visiting the island
were in bed long since, or ought to be, if they were not.
Closing the atlas, she followed the <i>criada</i> downstairs.
In the doorway, trying to make out the English of a
gigantic hall&ndash;porter, was a sturdy youth dressed in
sailor fashion. She recognized him at the first glance,
but some instinct warned her not to cry aloud her
astonishment.</p>

<p>Hurrying forward, she caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>“Chris!” she whispered, “is it really you?”</p>

<p>His chubby face creased with joy at the sight of
her.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss, it’s me right enough,” he said. “Can
you come with me to father? He’s orfly anxious ter
see yer, miss.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Out there in the road, miss, standin’ orf an’ on till
I heave in sight. He wouldn’t show up at the hotel,
miss, ‘cause ‘is wooden leg sort o’ makes folk stare at
‘im, an’ he don’t want too many people ter know ‘e
kem ‘ere to find you.”</p>

<p>“Came to find me&mdash;all the way from England?
Who sent him?”</p>

<p>They were in the roadway now, and walking fast in
the direction of the alameda, or public gardens, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a military band plays each evening for the inhabitants
of Las Palmas.</p>

<p>“Bless yer ‘eart, miss, we’ve done a lot more’n come
from England,” said Chris. “We’ve followed yer to
Scotland, an’ Germany, an’ France, an’ Madeira.
But father’ll tell you all about it. My eye, wasn’t’ e
pleased w’en our steamer rounded the mole an’ ‘e
sighted the <i>San Sowsy</i>. ‘Lord love a duck, Chris,’
sez ‘e, ‘there she is at last. Oo’ll say now that Peter
Evans ‘asn’t done as he was tole’!”</p>

<p>Evelyn, in her excitement, still held the boy’s arm.
He felt that she was trembling, though her voice was
calm.</p>

<p>“Chris,” she repeated, “who sent you?”</p>

<p>“Cap’n Warden, miss. But there! It’s dad’s yarn.
You must ‘ave it from ‘im, from chapter one to finis.”</p>

<p>Though on the brink of tears&mdash;for she was overwrought&mdash;the
girl could not help smiling.</p>

<p>“You are becoming quite literary,” she said.</p>

<p>“That’s the way I read a book if it’s any good, miss,&mdash;a
book like ‘The Scalp Hunters’ or ‘Nick of the
Woods’&mdash;every word, from beginnin’ to end. There
‘e is&mdash;that’s father&mdash;on the seat under the tree. I
s’pose ‘e’s tired. It was a long tramp through the
dust from the quay.”</p>

<p>Peter received her joyously.</p>

<p>“Sink me!” he cried, “but it’s a cure for sore eyes
ter see you at last, miss. It <i>is</i> you, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>He was not content until he had looked her full in
the face in the moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re a bit thinner,” he commented. “People
can say wot they like, but Ole England’s hard to beat
for fresh air an’ sound vittals. Chris an’ me would ha’
starved on that tub of a mail&ndash;boat if we ‘adn’t palled
in with the Scotch engineer, who med ‘em cook some
plain food. Hello! You’re bin cryin’? Now, wot
the&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Peter,” said Evelyn brokenly, “for Heaven’s
sake, if you have news of Captain Warden tell me
what it is.”</p>

<p>The ex&ndash;pilot produced a frayed and soiled parcel
from a pocket.</p>

<p>“There you are, miss,” he cried triumphantly.
“I’ve done it! ‘Find Miss Dane, no matter wot
it costs’&mdash;them’s my sailin’ orders from the cap’n.
‘Deliver this letter into Miss Dane’s own ‘ands.’
Right again!&mdash;as per code! Now, miss, if I was
you, I’d just open that there envelope an’ see
wot ‘e sez. Then, mebbe, I can fill in a bit. I tole
‘im I’d find you within a month, but I couldn’t!
Nobody could unless he was a bird, an’ a jolly good
flier at that. W’y, I’ve follered you pretty well round
the compass. An’ my godfather!&mdash;’aven’t you covered
up yer tracks!”</p>

<p>The first thing Evelyn’s trembling fingers withdrew
from the package was the jeweler’s case containing the
ring. When the diamonds flashed in the moonlight
she uttered a choking cry and her lips trembled pitifully.
So this was Arthur Warden’s answer to Rosamund
Laing’s jibes! Without hesitation, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
waiting to read a word of the many pages of manuscript
that accompanied it, she slipped it on to the
engagement finger of her left hand. It did not fit. It
was far too large. But what did that matter? Its
glories might await her scrutiny another time. Just
then she wanted to assure herself that she had gone
back to her allegiance before she was vouchsafed a
syllable of explanation. It was humility, not pride,
that governed her action.</p>

<p>Peter, however, did not regard the glittering ring
with such self&ndash;effacement. His prominent eyes bulged
with surprise, and he gripped his son’s shoulder emphatically.</p>

<p>“Tell you wot, Chris,” he whispered hoarsely. “If
we’d ha’ known wot was in that billy&ndash;doo we’d not ha’
slep’ so sound o’ nights!”</p>

<p>“Not while we was in furrin parts, father.”</p>

<p>“Not in any parts, me lad. Them sort o’ sparks’ll
get you a knife under your ribs anywhere. Now, if I
was Miss Dane, I’d turn it into money, quick. But
she won’t, mark my words. She’ll just twiddle it
round, an’ shove in a hairpin w’en there’s a chandelier
handy, an’ lean on ‘er elbow w’en the light shines on
the port bow&mdash;all to make the other wimmen green
with envy.”</p>

<p>Though Evelyn was deep in her letter&mdash;though her
brows were knitted and her little hands clenched as the
full measure of Rosamund’s perfidy was revealed to
her, she could not help overhearing Peter’s stage aside.
For a second her eyes were raised from the stupefying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
record, and they blazed with a light that surpassed the
fire in the diamonds.</p>

<p>“You are right, Peter,” she cried, and her voice
sounded shrilly in her own ears. “One woman, at
least, shall see my ring, even though envy were to kill
her.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pc1">EVELYN ENTERS THE FRAY</p>

<p class="p2">Only a woman can fathom another woman’s mind.
A man tries to think logically; a woman throws logic
to the winds, and reads her opponent’s tactics by
intuition. Though Warden was not wholly devoid of
suspicion of Rosamund’s disinterestedness when he
penned the plain statement which Evelyn now skimmed
through by the light of the Las Palmas moon, he little
dreamed that he was framing a damning indictment of
one who claimed to be his friend. But Evelyn extracted
from every line the hidden truth. A gentlewoman
to her finger&ndash;tips, her loathing of Mrs. Laing’s
despicable tactics was so overpowering for a while that
she could only vent her scorn and contempt by little
gasps and sobs of indignation.</p>

<p>Her lover’s account of events at Ostend and in London
was transparently honest. She saw now that by
some clever and unscrupulous device his letters and
telegrams had been withheld. The burking of her
own letters, sent with unfailing regularity until outraged
pride bade her cease, was equally clear. But
how had their common enemy achieved these results?
Why did Mrs. Laing flush and look guilty when Lord
Fairholme recognized Warden’s name half an hour ago?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Well, she would ask the genial little nobleman for an
explanation. He would be candid, she was sure; perhaps
he might help to illumine some of the dark places
of the last four months.</p>

<p>Peter Evans, watching her eyes as they devoured
page after page, winked solemnly at Chris, but held
his peace until the letter was restored to its envelope.
Then he felt that his innings had come.</p>

<p>“Well, miss,” he remarked quietly, “does that round
off everything in ship&ndash;shape style?”</p>

<p>For answer, she put both hands on his shoulders,
and looked into his weather&ndash;beaten face.</p>

<p>“Peter,” she said, “I can never repay you for what
you have done. Captain Warden tells me he had
faith in you, and indeed you have justified his confidence.
But how did you and Chris manage to travel
all this long way to find me? What has it cost you?
I have not much money at my command here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Money, miss? Did the Cap’n say nothink about
it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Just like ‘im. There never <i>was</i> a more free&ndash;handed
gent than ‘im. Funny thing, ain’t it, that the wrong
people are bloomin’ millionaires. I s’pose that’s w’y
they ‘ave it&mdash;coss they stick to it. Lord love a duck,
ther’s bin no trouble about <i>money</i>! He did some tricks
at the Casino&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, he has told me that.”</p>

<p>“Well, w’en ‘e gives me that there packidge, ‘e
forks out fifty quid, an’ says, ‘Peter, if you want more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
go to my bank.’ But fifty golden suvrins is a small
fortin to a sailorman&mdash;I’ve known the time it ‘ud
keep me an’ my missus an’ Chris for a year&mdash;an’ I
wasn’t flingin’ it about for bookin’ clerks an’ pursers
to pick up, neether. We ‘ad to dig a bit out o’ the
bank w’en this trip showed up, but afore that Chris an’
me worked our passidge to Scotland, an’ Hamburg,
an’ as far south as Bordeaux.”</p>

<p>“You went to Scotland? Why?”</p>

<p>“Afore the Cap’n left Lunnon ‘e ‘ad a telegram
from the coas&ndash;tguard to say the <i>San Sowsy</i> headed
sou’east by east from Lochmerig, an’ them ain’t the
sailin’ directions for the Shetlands, or they wasn’t w’en
I was at sea. It seemed to me some old salt thereabouts
might help a bit&mdash;fishermen keep a pretty
close eye on passin’ craft, miss&mdash;so off we goes. I
shipped as extra hand on the <i>Inverkeld</i>, bound from
London to Aberdeen, an’ Chris was stooard in the
engineers’ mess. Sure enough, I lights on a Montrose
herrin’&ndash;boat as ‘ad seen the yacht bearin’ away in the
line for Hamburg, I follered, on a tramp from Newcastle,
but I was a week late. You see, my orders
was ‘into her own ‘ands, Peter.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are a dear!”</p>

<p>“Well, mebbe. I’ve bin called most things in me
time, miss. But it’s spinnin’ a tremenjous long yarn
to go over all the ground. Wot I want to ax you now
is this&mdash;wot stopped Cap’n Warden from gettin’ your
letters?”</p>

<p>“Ah, Peter! a wicked woman, I am afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“D’ye ‘ear, Chris?” and Peter turned solemnly to
his son. “Wot did I tell yer? You see, miss,” he
went on, “I looked in at the Lodge, an’ med friends
with a servant or two, an’ it kem out that Mrs. Laing
collared a telegram addressed to you. ‘Was it himportant?’
sez one chap. ‘Reel himportant,’ sez I, ‘it
was from ‘er young man.’ Beg pardon, miss, but that’s
the way we talks among ourselves. ‘Oo is he?’ sez
the other fellow. ‘Captain Warden,’ sez I. ‘Not
Captain Arthur Warden, of Ostend?’ sez ‘e. ‘The
very man,’ sez I. ‘Dash my eyes,’ sez ‘e, ‘that’s queer.
Mrs. Laing wanted a letter out of the box one day
w’en I was goin’ to the post, an’ that’s the very name
as was on it. Wot’s ‘is little game? Is ‘e a&ndash;playin’ up
to both of ‘em?’ ‘Young man,’ sez I, ‘you don’t know
‘im. ‘E’s the straightest gentleman as ever wore shoe&ndash;leather.’
I axed ‘im w’en the incident occurred, as
they say in the noospapers, an’ ‘e tole me it was just
arter Mrs. Laing kem to Lochmerig. In fact, ‘e
wouldn’t ha’ known ‘oo she was if she ‘adn’t bin standin’
in the ‘all talkin’ to&mdash;to&mdash;wot’s ‘is name, Chris?”</p>

<p>“Lord Fairholme?” broke in Evelyn.</p>

<p>“No, miss, that wasn’t it&mdash;not in the same
street.”</p>

<p>“Billy Thring?”</p>

<p>“Tally! I’ve got it all logged up in my cabin. I
wasn’t sartin I’d see you to&ndash;night, or I’d ha’ brought
the book. That’s ‘im&mdash;Billy Thring&mdash;it sounds
familiar like, if he’s a swell, but that’s wot they called
‘im at Lochmerig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Peter, you are a wonder. You have found out the
one thing I wanted to know.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, miss, but you’re a bit of a wonder
yourself. If that was the on’y missin’ link, w’y didn’t
you write to me, care o’ the Pilots’ Office, Cardiff? I
could ha’ put you straight within a week. Any ship’s
skipper would ha’ guessed my address, if you tole ‘im
about the <i>Nancy</i> an’ gev ‘im my name.”</p>

<p>“I fear I am very much to blame,” said Evelyn
contritely. “But you hardly realize yet how I have
been victimized. Now I must go. It is very late.
Where are you staying?”</p>

<p>“Chris an’ me will turn in with our engineer friend
on board the <i>Cid</i>. At least that’s wot I call the old
tub, but these Spanish jokers make it into <i>Thith</i>.
Did y’ ever ‘ear anythink funnier’n that?”</p>

<p>She laughed blithely, arranged an early hour to
meet the two at the mole next day, and sped back to
the hotel. She wanted to read that thrice&ndash;precious
letter again. Seen in the moonlight, it seemed to be
fantastic, unreal. The words danced before her eyes.
Her brain had only half grasped its extraordinary
meanings.</p>

<p>In the privacy of her own room she should go through
it slowly, weighing its bewildering revelations, taking
to her very heart the outspoken, manly sentences that
assured her of Warden’s devotion, and planning with
new zest the means whereby she might circumvent her
enemies and his. Warden had been deceived even
more grossly than she herself. His faithful record of
Rosamund’s malicious innuendoes during the dinner
at the Savoy Hotel gave ample proof of that. It was
quite true she had talked with Figuero in the garden
at Lochmerig. The man naturally interested her; his
manner of speech was quaint, and he told her strange
things about the country in which the whole of her
lover’s active career might be passed. Was that a
crime? And how shameful that any woman should
write such a wicked untruth as to say that she had
gossiped to Thring and others about the men of Oku!
Of course, Mrs. Laing had obtained her information
from the stolen letter. Evelyn remembered perfectly
well the unfortunate postscript in which she alluded to
the negroes and the calabash. She meant only to
soften the harshness of her comments on Rosamund
and the two foreigners, but it was obvious now that
she could have written nothing more harmful to
Warden’s mission.</p>

<p>And then, with a sudden horror that made her white
to the lips, she realized what it meant&mdash;that Warden
had never received her letter, that Rosamund had
adroitly availed herself of the details it contained, and
that her lover had gone to Africa with a lurking doubt
in his heart of the one woman in the world whom he
trusted. Did he think her really the base creature she
was depicted? Oh, it was intolerable! She would
never forgive Mrs. Laing&mdash;no, never! Her rival had
stooped to a meanness that could not be borne&mdash;she
must be punished, with a vengeance at once swift and
merciless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>All this was very un&ndash;Christian, and wholly unlike
the delightfully shy yet lovable girl to whom Warden
lost his heart during the midsummer madness of Cowes
and Plymouth, but Evelyn was stirred to the depths
of a passionate nature; not for the first time in Las
Palmas, she cried herself to sleep.</p>

<p>She awoke in a better frame of mind, though still
determined to bring Mrs. Laing to her knees at the
first opportunity. Keeping the tryst with Peter, she
took him fully into her confidence. He was able to
supply many minor items of information that fitted the
pieces of the puzzle more accurately together. He
did not know what had become of Warden, but Evelyn
made no scruple of telling him the facts within her
knowledge.</p>

<p>She recked little of Government secrets and the
byways of Imperial politics. The ex&ndash;pilot and his
sturdy offspring were now the only witnesses of her
good faith. Perhaps they might meet Warden in
England before he was able to communicate with her.
In that event, she wanted Peter to be in a position to
do for her lover what he had done for her, and disabuse
Warden’s mind of the cloud of lies by which it had
been darkened.</p>

<p>Father and son were returning at once by the out&ndash;going
mail steamer. She pressed Peter to accept what
little money she could spare, but he would not take a
penny.</p>

<p>“No, miss,” he said, with emphatic head&ndash;shaking.
“There’s some shot left in the locker yet, an’ me an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>’
the Cap’n will ‘ave a reckonin’ w’en he comes ‘ome.
If I’m short of a pound or two afore I get the <i>Nancy</i>
in commission this spring, I’ll ax that gentleman at the
bank for it. P’raps you’ll write ‘im a line, an’ say
I’ve kep’ me contract.”</p>

<p>She had to be content with that. Were it practicable,
she would have gone back to England in the same
steamer. Here, in Las Palmas, she felt so utterly
unbefriended. Though thousands of miles nearer
Africa than in England, she seemed to be more thousands
of miles removed from the chance of receiving
a letter or a cablegram. True, she possessed a very
useful acquaintance in the commander of the <i>Valiant</i>,
but she could hardly expect one of His Majesty’s
cruisers to fly to and fro in the East Atlantic in order
to keep her conversant with developments in Nigeria.
Peter, however, undertook to call at the Colonial
Office, while she would cable him her address after
the lapse of a fortnight. Then, if there was any news
of Warden, he would communicate with her.</p>

<p>At luncheon she had her first meeting with Mrs.
Laing since the arrival of that epoch&ndash;marking letter.
A special menu was ordered, and the table was gay
with flowers, for the Baumgartners dearly loved a
lord, and were resolved to make the most of their
friendly relations with the Earl of Fairholme.</p>

<p>Mr. Baumgartner looked worried and preoccupied.
The coming of the mail which meant so much to
Evelyn perhaps had its importance for him also. At
any rate, he left the entertainment of his guests largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to his wife, until a sharp clash of wits rudely dispelled
his reverie.</p>

<p>Beryl Baumgartner was the unconscious agent that
brought about an unforeseen crisis. Her restless eyes
speedily caught the glint of diamonds on Evelyn’s left
hand, and she cried ecstatically:</p>

<p>“Oh, Evelyn, what a lovely ring! Where did you
get it?”</p>

<p>Each woman at the table was on the <i>qui vive</i> instantly.
In a place like Las Palmas the mere mention of a
diamond ring in connection with a young and pretty
girl suggests that one more infatuated male has voluntarily
removed his name from the list of eligibles.</p>

<p>Evelyn, having stilled the volcano that raged over
night, might have allowed the opportunity to pass if
she had not happened to catch the mocking smile on
Rosamund’s face when the nature of the ring became
self&ndash;evident. That steeled her intent.</p>

<p>“It is my engagement ring,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>“What?” shrieked Beryl, to whom this was news
indeed. “Who is he?”</p>

<p>“You do not know him, dear, but his name is Captain
Warden. He is at present in West Africa, somewhere
near the Benuë River.”</p>

<p>“And did he send it to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I received it only last night. It would have
reached me four months ago, had not Mrs. Laing
stolen one of my letters&mdash;perhaps others as well&mdash;and
that naturally led to some confusion.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of stupefied silence at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
table. Everybody seemed to be stricken dumb. Rosamund,
crimson with anger, could only mutter:</p>

<p>“What insolence!”</p>

<p>“It is an unpleasant thing to say, but it is true,”
said Evelyn, discussing her rival’s transgression in the
most matter&ndash;of&ndash;fact tone, though she was conscious of
a queer tingling at the roots of her hair, and she hardly
recognized the sound of her own voice.</p>

<p>Baumgartner felt it imperative to stop what threatened
to develop into a scandal.</p>

<p>“Miss Dane, you are making a serious charge against
a lady of the highest repute,” he said, in his best chairman&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;company
style.</p>

<p>“I mean it, every word,” cried Evelyn, a trifle more
vehemently. “Lord Fairholme, am I speaking the
truth or not?” she demanded, suddenly wheeling
round on the inoffensive peer.</p>

<p>“Really&mdash;er&mdash;really&mdash;&mdash;” he spluttered, for once
too bewildered to grin.</p>

<p>“Please tell Mr. Baumgartner what happened in
the hall at Lochmerig when Mrs. Laing asked the
postman to give her a letter addressed to Captain
Arthur Warden, at Ostend. You were present. It
was my letter she obtained. Perhaps she has it yet if
her boxes were searched.”</p>

<p>Here was no timid girl striving vainly to bolster up
a false accusation, but a fiery young goddess impeaching
an erring mortal. The atmosphere was electrical;
Beryl Baumgartner said afterwards that she felt pins
and needles attacking her at all points!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry, Miss Dane, but I gave very
little attention to the incident,” said Fairholme, partly
recovering himself.</p>

<p>“But you remembered Captain Warden’s name last
night? Was it not at Lochmerig that you heard it,
and from Mrs. Laing?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;yes, but, you know, Mrs. Laing might have
written to him.”</p>

<p>“She did, after obtaining the address from my letter
and reading what I wrote.”</p>

<p>Then she turned on Rosamund with magnificent
disdain.</p>

<p>“Shall I give you a copy of your letter? Captain
Warden has sent it to me.”</p>

<p>Sheer fury enabled Rosamund to regain her self&ndash;control.</p>

<p>“Your foolish attack on me is disproved out of
your own mouth,” she said, striving desperately to
speak with her accustomed nonchalance. “Captain
Warden has not written to you since I saw him in
London. He is in Africa, it is true, but he has never
been heard of after going ashore at Rabat fully three
months ago. How can you pretend that you received
a letter from him last night? My authority is an
Under Secretary of State. Pray, who is yours?”</p>

<p>Under other conditions, Evelyn might have been
warned by the imperious command to “hold her
tongue” that Baumgartner telegraphed to his wife
when that good lady was minded to interfere. But
no consideration would stop her now. The memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of all she had suffered through the machinations of one
evilly disposed woman upset her calm judgment. In
other respects, she acted with a restraint that was
worthy of a first&ndash;rate actress; people at the next table
might have thought she was discussing the weather.
Taking Warden’s letter from her pocket, she handed
it to Lord Fairholme.</p>

<p>“I cited you as a witness,” she said. “Will you
now act as a judge? Read that, and tell my friends
which of us two is speaking truly.”</p>

<p>Despite his self&ndash;supposed shortcomings, Fairholme
was a gentleman. Instinctively he believed Evelyn,
but he shrank from the duty she entrusted to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say,” he bleated, “hasn’t this thing gone a
bit too far already? Is it worth all the beastly fuss?
There may be a mistake somewhere, you know. I’m
sure, Miss Dane, nobody doubts your statement where
this lucky chap Warden is concerned, an’, on the other
hand, don’t you know, Mrs. Laing may have a perfectly
fair explanation of the other business. So let
it go at that, eh, what?”</p>

<p>“May I act as arbitrator?” said Baumgartner. “If
I glance through your letter, Miss Dane, I may discover
a means of settlement.”</p>

<p>Something in his tone, some hint of a crafty purpose
behind the smooth&ndash;spoken words, beat through the
haze of wrath and grief that clouded Evelyn’s mind.
She could trust Fairholme with her lover’s letter, but
not Baumgartner. To reveal to him what Warden
had said about Mrs. Laing’s extraordinarily accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
knowledge of proceedings in the Solent and affairs in
Nigeria would be tantamount to betraying her lover’s
faith.</p>

<p>With splendid calmness she took the letter from the
table and replaced it in her pocket.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mr. Baumgartner,” she said, “if
Lord Fairholme declines to help me, nobody else can
take his place. I appealed to him because he is aware
that Mrs. Laing induced your groom to unlock the
post&ndash;box and hand her my letter. The proof of my
words lies here. It is for him to say whether or not
he is satisfied he saw Mrs. Laing commit a theft.”</p>

<p>Fairholme shook his head. He was not lacking in
pluck, and his artificial humor was only the veneer of
an honest nature, but he surprised a look in Rosamund’s
eyes that startled him. She was pale now,
ashen pale. She uttered no word, but continued to
glower at Evelyn with a suppressed malevolence that
was more threatening than the mere rage of a detected
trickster.</p>

<p>His lordship evidently thought it high time Baumgartner
or his wife exercised their authority.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think this matter has gone quite far
enough?” he asked, glancing from one to the other,
and avoiding the eyes of either Evelyn or Mrs.
Laing.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Baumgartner, speaking with a pomposity
that contrasted sharply with his prompt offer to
supplant Fairholme as judge. “This absurd dispute
about a purely private affair must end at once. I and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
my family are going to Europe by the next mail
steamer&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Isadore!” gasped his wife.</p>

<p>“Father, you can’t mean it!” cried Beryl, who, at
the lowest calculation, had made arrangements for a
good three weeks’ further frivolity at Las Palmas.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, I am quite in earnest.”</p>

<p>The financier looked it. Despite his magisterial air,
his puffy face was drawn and haggard, and he had the
aspect of a man who needed rest and sleep.</p>

<p>“You will accompany us, of course, Miss Dane,”
he went on, speaking slowly, as though he were groping
for the best way out of a difficulty. “Your quarrel
with Mrs. Laing can be much more easily adjusted in
England than here. I hope, therefore, we shall be
spared further bickering during our brief stay in the
Canaries.”</p>

<p>“But, father dear,” put in his daughter, “you said
we were going home on the yacht, and calling at
Gibraltar and Algiers.”</p>

<p>“I have changed my plans,” he retorted curtly, and
that was all he would say on the subject.</p>

<p>Evelyn left the table at the earliest moment. When
too late, she regretted the impulse that led her to declare
open war against Mrs. Laing. But it was done now.
Those words “theft” and “steal” were irrevocable.
She had retreated to a nook in the garden where a
dense clump of tropical trees and shrubs gave shelter
from the sun, and was trying to discover if she had
imperilled the success of Warden’s mission by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
unguarded phrase, when Lord Fairholme came to
her.</p>

<p>“May I sit down here a few minutes?” he asked.
“I want to try to understand things.”</p>

<p>“I should be sorry to test your lordship’s capacity
so greatly,” she said. She had not yet forgiven him
for not taking her part. She was young; her world
was tumbling about her ears; she believed that everybody
ought to stand aghast at Rosamund’s wickedness.</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, that’s a bit severe, isn’t it?” grinned
Fairholme. “You don’t make allowances for the
ruffled feelin’s of a poor fellow who has just had his
image battered&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will you please tell me what you are talking about?”</p>

<p>“Eh&mdash;beg pardon, I meant idol shattered. Silly
mistake, eh, what?”</p>

<p>Evelyn’s lips relaxed in a smile. There was no
resisting “Billy” when (in his own phrase) he was
goin’ strong.</p>

<p>“I fear you all thought me very rude,” she said,
with a pathetic little gesture of helplessness. “But
what was I to do?&mdash;listen in silence to fresh insults?”</p>

<p>“I think you did the only possible thing.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you refuse to bear out my statement?”</p>

<p>“There were reasons. May I see that letter now?”</p>

<p>“Have you come of your own accord?” she asked.</p>

<p>Evelyn fighting for the man she loved was a very
different girl from the proud, disdainful Evelyn who,
twenty&ndash;four hours earlier, would have endured almost
any infliction rather than flout her adversary in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
public dining&ndash;room. She credited Rosamund with the
adoption of any petty device to gain her ends, and felt
that Fairholme was just the man to be used as a stalking&ndash;horse.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “or rather, yes&mdash;and no. I am
anxious to know the truth, but Baumgartner suggested
that I ought to accept your offer of reading the evidence.
Don’t you see, he has to consider the future a bit.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“Well, if Mrs. Laing stole a letter in his house, she&mdash;it’s
a jolly hard thing to say&mdash;but she must be
warned off.”</p>

<p>Baumgartner as a guardian of morals was a new
conception. Evelyn felt that a more powerful foe
than Rosamund was in the field. Her unimportant
romance had suddenly widened out into the world&ndash;domain
of politics. She must decide quickly and
decide right. In that vital moment she realized that
her postscript to the Lochmerig letter might have
consequences far beyond their effect on Warden’s
fortunes and her own.</p>

<p>“Lord Fairholme,” she said, turning so that she
could watch the slightest change in the expression of
his face, “does Mr. Baumgartner strike you as a man
who would go out of his way to interfere in a dispute
between two women?”</p>

<p>“Not unless there was money in it,” said Fairholme
cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Then why is he showing such interest now in a
matter which he deliberately closed at luncheon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“I gave you his explanation. Even Baumgartner
likes to associate with people of good character.”</p>

<p>“No, that is not the reason. Mr. Baumgartner is
engaged at this moment in a plot against British dominion
in West Africa. You see that cruiser in the
harbor? Well, she is here to watch the <i>Sans Souci</i>.
You yourself heard to&ndash;day that our party is going to
Europe by the mail steamer. Why, when the <i>Sans
Souci</i> is at our disposal? I will tell you. The British
authorities believe that the yacht will help, or further
in some way, a native rising in Southern Nigeria. Now,
the letter in my possession, read by any one who could
extract its inner meaning, would yield a valuable clue
to the amount of information at the disposal of the
home government. If you, without knowing this,
answered Mr. Baumgartner’s questions as to its contents,
you would be doing the gravest injury to Great
Britain.”</p>

<p>“By gad!” exclaimed Fairholme.</p>

<p>“You can easily assure yourself that I am not exaggerating
the facts. Here is the letter. Read it, and
remember what I have told you.”</p>

<p>Fairholme pursed his lips and bent his brows in
deep mental effort. He held the letter in his hand
unopened during this unusual and seemingly painful
process. Then he gave it back to Evelyn.</p>

<p>“No, Miss Dane,” he said emphatically. “I’m far
too candid an ass to be laden with state secrets. Now,
if you wouldn’t mind just pickin’ out the bits that
refer to Mrs. Laing, an’ skippin’ all the political part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
I’ll be able to bounce old Baumgartner for all he’s
worth.”</p>

<p>“But I cannot. It is the political part which proves
that my letter was stolen.”</p>

<p>“Same thing! Change the names. Turn West
Africa into Newmarket, an’ call the Emperor Lord
Rosebery.”</p>

<p>“The Emperor,” said Evelyn, surprised at Fairholme’s
chance shot.</p>

<p>“He’s in it, I guess. He has his finger in every pie,
an’ some of ‘em have bin jolly hot. Now, go ahead.
If it’s at all awkward, leave me to fill in a bit about the
Ditch Mile an’ the Epsom gradients that will bamboozle
Baumgartner.”</p>

<p>Evelyn did her best. Fairholme was delighted with
Warden’s description of the baccarat and roulette
incidents, but his face lengthened when he heard
Rosamund’s allusions to himself. Once, Evelyn forgot
his stipulation, and spoke of the “men of Oku.”</p>

<p>“Oku,” broke in Fairholme, “where is that?”</p>

<p>“It is a savage native state in West Africa. That is
the one name you must not remember, Lord Fairholme.”</p>

<p>He did not interrupt again till she had finished
reading. Then she told him how Peter Evans had
brought her the ring and the letter; and, finding him
sympathetic, she explained the extraordinary chance
that led to Warden’s capture by a Mohammedan
fanatic at Rabat.</p>

<p>“Funny thing!” he said, when she had made an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
end. “That chap Figuero joined my steamer at
Lisbon.”</p>

<p>“He is not here?” cried Evelyn, genuinely startled,
for she feared Figuero.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is. I fancy he’s on board the <i>Sans Souci</i>.
I didn’t speak to him; I have a notion that he didn’t
recognize me under my new name. We also picked
up a number of German officers at the same port, but
they left us at Funchal, where another ship took them
on to the Cameroons. That is German West Africa,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I believe so. My geographical knowledge of this
part of the world is of the vaguest. It dates chiefly
from last night.”</p>

<p>“When the naval Johnny was showing you the map,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“But how do you know that?” she demanded, and
another wave of surprise flooded her face with color.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Laing and I watched you for quite a time&mdash;the
watchin’ was involuntary on my part, but she
wouldn’t come away from the veranda, an’ now I
know why. You will observe, Miss Dane, that I have
bin the goat all through the proceedin’s.”</p>

<p>“I can hardly say that.”</p>

<p>“No, you wouldn’t. But it’s true. The only bit
of luck I’ve had is that I am saved the painful necessity
of bein’ refused as a husband by Mrs. Laing. I came
here to ask her to marry me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry&mdash;&mdash;” began Evelyn, but Fairholme’s
cackling laugh checked her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why sorry? You’ve done me a good turn, twice
over, an’ if I can do you one, just ask. In the first
place, she would probably have said ‘No,’ and in the
second, where should I have been if she said ‘Yes.’
In the soup, eh, what?”</p>

<p>Lord Fairholme seemed to pride himself on his
narrow escape, and gave Evelyn the credit of rescuing
him. She protested that if she had known he was
really bent on marrying Mrs. Laing she would neither
have attacked the latter in his presence nor called on
him to bear out her statements. But he refused to
admit that she had conferred other than a favor on
him, and repeated his desire to serve her if the opportunity
offered. It came quickly.</p>

<p>That night, when Evelyn was sound asleep, her
room was entered and Warden’s letter taken. It lay
with the ring and some other trinkets on a dressing&ndash;table.
The door was locked and bolted, but the
window was wide open to admit the sea breeze, and,
although the room was on the third floor, and therefore
some forty feet or more above the ground level, it was
impossible that the thief could have entered it except
through the window. That the letter alone was the
objective was shown by the fact that the exceedingly
valuable ring was left untouched. There was almost
a hint of malicious humor in the discrimination exercised.
An ordinary criminal, though bribed to procure
a document of great importance to some other
person, would certainly have made away with any
jewelry that was lying handy. In this instance, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
seemed to be an unspoken warning to the girl that she
was powerless in the toils that surrounded her.</p>

<p>At first, she suspected Rosamund of complicity in
this new theft, but when she asked herself who had
most to gain from the perusal of the letter, suspicion
pointed, not to Rosamund, who could guess its contents
with fair accuracy, but to Baumgartner and his
associates, who were evidently more afraid of one man
than of the armed might of Britain.</p>

<p>In the height of her distress her employer came to her.</p>

<p>“We have decided to return by the Portuguese mail
from Madeira,” he said, “and in order to catch the
next steamer we shall sail in the <i>Sans Souci</i> to&ndash;night.
Would it be convenient for you to go aboard the yacht
this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“But what action am I to take with regard to my
stolen letter?” she demanded. “You heard what I
said to Mrs. Laing. That letter is my evidence against
her.”</p>

<p>“It may have blown out of your window. There is
generally a strong breeze just before dawn. At any
rate, it is better lost. Such disputes are useless.”</p>

<p>“But it was of the utmost importance in other ways.”</p>

<p>“Young ladies’ love&ndash;letters always are,” he gurgled
with forced laughter. “Still, if it really has gone, you
can hardly propose to remain in Las Palmas on the
off chance that it may be recovered.”</p>

<p>She felt that she was trapped, but for what purpose
it was hard to imagine. Lord Fairholme had told her
already that Baumgartner was very much annoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
with him for failing to remember what Warden had written,
and it was now beyond doubt that the <i>Sans Souci’s</i>
voyage to Funchal was a blind for some ulterior object.</p>

<p>In her dilemma, she thought of Mortimer. When
Baumgartner went away, she hurried out of the hotel
and drove straight to the harbor. A boat brought her
to the <i>Valiant</i>; the commander himself met her at the
gangway, and escorted her to his cabin.</p>

<p>“Sorry I couldn’t call last evening Miss Dane,” he
said, “but I was detained on board unexpectedly.
Things are happening, I hear.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Figuero is here, and we leave on the yacht
for Funchal to&ndash;night.”</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“Is that the dodge?” he exclaimed. “Of course, I
was posted in the movements of the Portuguese and
his friends, but the trip to Madeira is clever. What
has caused the change of programme?”</p>

<p>She told him, and he banged a clenched fist emphatically
on a table which a steward had just arranged
for tea.</p>

<p>“For once, I can find it in my heart to wish you were
a man,” he cried. “A steamer starts for Lagos within
two hours, and it would be a fine thing if the Nigeria
administration heard your story from your own lips.
Of course, I can write, but it is difficult to put on paper
one’s guesses and surmises at the trickery that is going
on.”</p>

<p>The words were scarcely uttered ere a wild notion
leaped into Evelyn’s brain. Why should she not go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
to Lagos? She might be able to clear away some of
the doubts and misgivings that must have gathered
around Warden’s name. Above all else, if there was
news of him, it would surely reach the officials there
long before it became known in England.</p>

<p>“If I were a man,” she said tremulously, “would
you pay my passage on that ship?”</p>

<p>“Of course. You would be traveling on Government
service.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall go. Please arrange matters for me,
and send some one to take me on board.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean it?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, Miss Dane, you astonish me more each
time I see you. But how about the Baumgartners?”</p>

<p>“I shall simply write a note resigning my situation.
It is a mere question of doing that to&ndash;day or three
weeks hence. But I shall not tell them why I am
leaving their service so suddenly.”</p>

<p>“Baumgartner will find out. Unless I am much
mistaken, it will worry him. Now, you are sure you
intend to take this trip?”</p>

<p>“Quite certain.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I shall give myself the pleasure of
calling for you at three o’clock.”</p>

<p>Evelyn packed her boxes as speedily as possible.
Counting her money, she found she had only twenty&ndash;five
pounds. But there was that new treasure, the
ring. How better could she use it than in furthering
the interests of the man she loved? She wondered if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Lord Fairholme would lend her fifty pounds on its
security? A note brought him to her room, and she
explained briefly that she meant to visit Lagos, and
might need more funds than she had at her command.</p>

<p>“Well, that beats the band,” he said. “Mrs. Laing
is going there too.”</p>

<p>“Not on to&ndash;day’s steamer?” she protested, for it
seemed that an unkind fate was conspiring against her.</p>

<p>“Sure thing! Heard her tellin’ Beryl an hour ago.”</p>

<p>Though Evelyn wished heartily that her rival had
chosen any other route of the many which lead from
Las Palmas, her resolution remained unaltered. But
there was another thrill in store for her.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, Miss Dane,” said Fairholme, “I
don’t think you ought to tackle an expedition of this
sort single&ndash;handed. You may want some one to pull
you out of a tight place&mdash;what price me as a puller&ndash;out?
I’m a pretty useless sort of chap in most things,
but there is no reason why I shouldn’t try to do my
country a good turn once in a way. Let me go with
you, and then you’ll have no need to worry about coin.”</p>

<p>“You are really very kind,” she faltered, “but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are afraid of Mrs. Laing again,” he grinned.
“Don’t worry yourself about her, dear girl. Not even
Mrs. Grundy can growl at me for bein’ your fellow&ndash;passenger.
I’m mixed up in this business, an’, by
Jove, I mean to see it through. Look here, can’t you
adopt me as a sort of elder brother, an’ make it ‘Billy’
an’ ‘Evelyn,’ an’ that sort of thing&mdash;eh, what?”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pc1">THE DRUMS OF OKU</p>

<p class="p2">Evelyn, ferried across the harbor by a boat’s crew
from the warship, boarded the <i>Estremadura</i> in almost
regal state. The vessel’s cabin accommodation was
poor, but the English girl was given of its best. Not
every day does a small West African trader receive a
passenger under the escort of a peer of the realm and
a Captain in the Royal Navy. It was an interesting
moment when Rosamund Laing, accompanied by
Figuero, came alongside. The Portuguese made off
at once, but the lady, when it was too late to retreat,
affected a blank indifference to Evelyn’s presence that
showed how conscious she was of it. She seldom
appeared on deck, ate each meal in the seclusion of
her cabin, and spoke no word, even to Lord Fairholme.
On arriving at Lagos she hurried from the ship, and
Evelyn breathed a sigh of relief as she watched her
enemy go ashore.</p>

<p>She did not carry her dislike of Mrs. Laing to the
point of imagining her to be in active co&ndash;operation
with the plotters against British supremacy in that
quarter of the world. It was far more probable that a
rich woman who drew some part of her revenues from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
factories on the coast might be combining business
with the desire to obtain news of Warden at first hand.
At any rate, the girl fondly hoped they might never
meet again, and she trusted to the strength of her own
story, supplemented by a letter from Captain Mortimer
to the Governor, to place her beyond the reach
of misrepresentation.</p>

<p>But her troubles, instead of diminishing, became
even more pronounced when she called at Government
House. Both she and Lord Fairholme were entirely
ignorant of local conditions. Neither of them knew
that Lagos, though the chief West African port, and
practically the only safe harbor on the Guinea Coast,
was the capital of an administration quite separate
from that of North and of South Nigeria. To reach
Old Calabar, the headquarters of Warden’s service,
they must take a long journey down the coast and
penetrate some forty miles into the Niger delta. Captain
Mortimer, in all probability, thought she was
aware of this vital distinction, but, at the outset, Evelyn
almost felt that she had undertaken a useless task.</p>

<p>Her manifest distress at an unpleasing discovery
won her the sympathy of the deputy Governor of Lagos,
his chief having crossed from the island to the mainland
only the day before. But sympathy could not
altogether cloak a skepticism that was galling in the
extreme. He was fully acquainted with the position
of affairs in the sister protectorate, he said. He appreciated
Captain Mortimer’s motives in wishing to
acquaint the Government of Nigeria with certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
curious circumstances which might or might not be
connected with tribal uneasiness in the Benuë River
districts, but the fact remained that all was quiet now
in that region.</p>

<p>“Owing to Captain Warden’s unfortunate disappearance,”
he went on, “another commissioner visited
Oku. He found matters there in a fairly settled state.
The people were cultivating their lands with greater
assiduity than such semi&ndash;cannibals usually display,
and this is a sure sign of content in a West African
community. Indeed, Captain Forbes is now about to
return to headquarters. A few companies of Hausa
constabulary, who were moved to more convenient
centers in case a strong column was required for an
expedition to the Benuë, are going back to their original
cantonments. The incident is ended.”</p>

<p>The official tone was blandly disconcerting. Evelyn
was aware that the deputy Governor looked on her
somewhat in the light of a runaway schoolgirl, who had
no reason whatever to bother her pretty head about
the business of a prosperous and thriving colony.</p>

<p>“You seem to imply that the Home authorities
acted in a panic,” she said, wondering if it were really
true that Warden and the men he had seen in London
were laboring under a delusion.</p>

<p>“No. They misread the motives of the Nigeria
administration in curtailing Captain Warden’s furlough&mdash;that
is all. There undoubtedly were rumors
of some border disturbances. The people in that
region hinted that the Oku men were arranging what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
they term a Long Ju&ndash;ju. There was also a trading
activity on the part of our neighbors that gave rise to
unpleasant suspicions. To be forewarned is to be
forearmed, and His Excellency the Governor regarded
Captain Warden as the man who could best deal with
and remove any causes of discontent. Within the last
two months, however, all unfavorable symptoms have
vanished, and Oku is now as quiet as Old Calabar, or
Lagos itself.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of it,” she said earnestly. “It is far
from my wish to figure as a messenger of strife. May
I revert to a more personal matter? If Captain
Warden has succeeded in crossing the Sahara, when
and where may I reasonably expect to hear of him?”</p>

<p>The deputy Governor stroked his chin. He was a
kind&ndash;hearted man, and circumstances had prepared
him for that question.</p>

<p>“It is hard to say,” he answered, “Assuming he
reaches Timbuktu in safety, he can follow that course
of the Upper Niger, through what is known as the
Dahomey hinterland, until he arrives at Ilo, the first
town in the British sphere of influence in that direction.
Thence to the sea, at this season, the river is navigable.
If he makes for Lagos&mdash;having been ordered here in
the first instance&mdash;he might strike overland from
Jebbu to the railhead at Ibadan, but if he sticks to the
river and goes to his own headquarters, by remaining
here you should obtain telegraphic information of his
arrival at a town called Lokoja, situated at the junction
of the Niger and the Benuë<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>He paused. His brief review conveyed no hint to
his hearer of the tremendous difficulties any man must
overcome ere he reached the comparative civilization
of the telegraph, and he flinched from the task of
enlightening her.</p>

<p>“Is it quite certain,” he asked, “that Captain
Warden went ashore at Rabat?”</p>

<p>The astonishment in Evelyn’s face was almost sufficient
answer.</p>

<p>“Unless every one in some Government department
in London has gone mad, it is quite certain,” she cried.
“Did not an officer from Nigeria go to meet him at
Cape Coast Castle, and is it not evident that he went
to Hassan’s Tower to obtain the ruby I have told you
of?”</p>

<p>The official smiled. He had effectually distracted
her thoughts from the far more embarrassing topic of
Warden’s chances of reaching Nigeria alive.</p>

<p>“One learns to distrust circumstantial evidence, Miss
Dane. Have you heard that the passenger on the
<i>Water Witch</i> was known as Mr. Alfred Williams?
Yes? Well, we do not know Captain Warden. We
have no means here of identifying the baggage landed
by the captain of the <i>Water Witch</i> when he reported
the Rabat incident. Could you recognize any of
Captain Warden’s belongings?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Evelyn blankly&mdash;“that is, I fear
not.”</p>

<p>“You mentioned a gourd. I have not seen the
thing myself, but one of my assistants says that a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
remarkable object of that nature was found in one of
the missing man’s boxes.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I should know that anywhere,” and she shuddered
at the recollection of the evil face whose appearance
had so strangely synchronized with the stormy
events of her recent life.</p>

<p>“Well, have you any objection to examining the
gourd now? If it is the undoubted article you picked
up in the Solent, it goes far to prove that Captain
Warden did really take passage on the <i>Water Witch</i>.”</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine how you can think otherwise,”
she declared. “Of course it was he!”</p>

<p>“There is no harm in making sure,” he said, having
already decided to entrust to his wife the trying duty
of making known to this charming girl the almost
certain fact that her lover was long since dead.</p>

<p>The calabash was brought and taken from its canvas
wrapper. Oddly enough, mildew had formed on its
bright lacquer, and the sheen of the mosaic eyes was
dulled. It had lost some of its artistic power, and was
far from being the terrifying creation that scared her
so badly when first she saw it on the deck of the
<i>Nancy</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is it,” she said. “You see, this crown
is really a lid, and the piece of vellum, or parchment,
was hidden inside. It is not there now, yet it is more
than likely that Captain Warden kept them both together.”</p>

<p>The servant who had brought the calabash was sent
back to search for the tattooed skin. He soon returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
with it, and the deputy Governor examined the two
curios with manifest interest.</p>

<p>“It is not native work,” he said. “I have never
seen anything just like it, even in museums at home.”</p>

<p>Moved by an impulse which she could never afterwards
explain, Evelyn asked if both the gourd and
the parchment might be given to her.</p>

<p>“They are really mine,” she explained sadly. “Captain
Warden asked me to accept the carved head, as it
was I who discovered it. But I was afraid of it then.
Now, I should be pleased to have it in my possession.
It brought us together in the first instance. Perhaps
it may do the same thing a second time.”</p>

<p>“Nigeria is the home of the ju&ndash;ju&mdash;may this fetish
prove a lucky one!” said the official gravely. “Take
it, by all means, Miss Dane, but let no native see it, or
you will attract a notoriety that I am sure you would
dislike. Meanwhile, I shall telegraph to Old Calabar
asking for news, though I should certainly have heard
if Warden had turned up already.”</p>

<p>That same afternoon the deputy Governor’s wife
called on Evelyn, and invited her to come and stay at
her house, urging that she would find residence in a
private family vastly preferable to the hotel in which
she had passed the previous night. For fully three
weeks she lived with this most friendly and hospitable
lady. By degrees, as they became more intimate, her
new acquaintance gathered the threads of the unusual
story in which the girl figured so prominently. Similarly,
as Evelyn gained more knowledge of African<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
affairs, she could not help but discover that it would
be nothing less than a miracle if Warden ever reached
Nigeria. The difficulties facing even a well&ndash;equipped
expedition on the desert route were so great that all
but the most enthusiastic explorers shrank from them.
How, then, could one white man, accompanied by a
solitary Hausa, hope to overcome them? The deputy
Governor scouted the idea that Warden could raise a
caravan at Bel Abbas. He was dubious about the
incidents reported from Lektawa, but he made no
secret of the utter improbability that Warden would
have the means of buying camels and hiring men for
the dangerous journey outlined by Captain Mortimer.
And, to complete Evelyn’s dismay, the Southern
Nigeria administration sent the most positive assurances
that Warden had not been heard of in the upper
river districts.</p>

<p>She learned incidentally that Mrs. Laing had gone
to Lokoja in a river steamer. Her hostess believed
that Rosamund had found out the latest version of
Warden’s adventures, and cherished a faint hope that
even yet she might forestall Evelyn. No small consideration
would take her so far into the interior,
especially as the journey was both risky and useless.</p>

<p>“But that need not trouble you at all, my dear,”
said her outspoken friend. “If Captain Warden
lives, you can rest assured that my husband will hear
of him long before Mrs. Laing hears. I am afraid
that if news comes at all, it will reach us in the form
of a native rumor that a white man died of fever away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
up there beyond the hills. It is always fever&mdash;never
a spear thrust or a quantity of powdered glass mixed
with a man’s food. The natives are loyal enough to
each other in that respect. Even when they know the
truth, it is almost impossible to get them to tell it.”</p>

<p>So now it was death, and not life, that was talked
of, and Evelyn lived on in dry&ndash;eyed misery until Fairholme
hinted one day that she ought to return home,
as the climate was beginning to affect her health.</p>

<p>There were not lacking indications that the merry&ndash;souled
little peer had quickly reconciled himself to
the loss of Mrs. Laing. He was the most popular
man in Lagos, and he hardly ever visited Evelyn
when he did not assure her that he was “havin’ a
giddy time with the dear girls.“ Yet she knew that
he was only waiting until the last hope of Warden’s
escape from the desert must be abandoned. When
that hour came, and she was prepared to take ship
for England, Fairholme would ask her to marry him.</p>

<p>The belief became an obsession. To get away
from it, to cut herself wholly adrift from painful associations,
she offered her help to an American Baptist
missionary and his wife who were going up the Benuë.
They tried to dissuade her, pointing out the hardships
and positive dangers of the undertaking and the humdrum
nature of the nursing, teaching, and doctoring
that constituted the lot of a medical missionary in
West Africa. Finally, they consented, but stipulated
that she should give her new career a six months’
trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>Fairholme protested, and stormed, and was only
prevented from proposing on the spot by Evelyn’s
placid statement that no matter what the future might
decide, she should not be happy unless she had visited
the little&ndash;known land to which her lover had given
the best years of his life.</p>

<p>The reference to Warden effectually sealed his
lips. He hastened to the club, asked a man to dine
with him, drank the larger part of a bottle of champagne,
and mournfully informed his friends that he
had never enjoyed a moment’s real fun since he ceased
to be hard up.</p>

<p>So Evelyn said good&ndash;by to the hospitable people
who entertained her at Lagos, and made the long voyage
up the great river that perplexed mankind during
so many centuries. Even yet its whole course has
not been surveyed, and it has important tributaries
that are unknown beyond their confluence with the
main stream. But the river steamer followed the
established trade route through Old Calabar and
Asabao and Idah to Lokoja; thence a steam launch
took the small party of Europeans up the Benuë to
Ibi, and they completed the journey in a roofed boat
of shallow draft manned by krooboys.</p>

<p>The girl seemed now to have left behind the cares
and troubles of the outer world. Busying herself
with the daily life of the mission compound&mdash;once a
stockaded trading&ndash;station and noted center for the
distribution of gin, but now a peaceful hive of simple
tuition and industry&mdash;she soon experienced a calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
sense of duty accomplished that had certainly been
denied her in the Baumgartner household. At Lagos
she had received one letter from Beryl, who complained
bitterly of her “desertion.“ A police patrol&ndash;boat
brought her a letter from home, in which her stepmother
expressed the strongest disapproval of her new
departure as announced by a hurried note sent from
Lagos. And that was all. The links that bound
her with England were completely snapped. She
might almost be the kidnapped Domenico Garcia,
of whom she thought occasionally when some chance
aspect of a negro’s face startled her by its close resemblance
to the black mask on the calabash.</p>

<p>Mindful of the Lagos official’s warning, she never
showed the carved head to any one. Not even Mr.
and Mrs. Hume, the mission couple, knew that it was
in her possession.</p>

<p>She had been nearly two months in Kadana, as the
group of houses and huts in the clearing by the side
of the yellow Benuë was called, when an apparently
trivial incident upset the placid routine of the mission.
One evening, just before sunset, a ju&ndash;ju man, fearsomely
bedaubed, and decked with an amazing headdress
and skirt of scarlet feathers, came into the native section
of the compound. He cut off the head of an unhappy
fowl that he carried with him, sprinkled its
warm blood in a circle on the ground, chanted some
hoarse incantation, and vanished into the bush.</p>

<p>The white people saw him from a distance. They
happened to be standing on the veranda of an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
factory used as a schoolhouse and dwelling, and
Mr. Hume was greatly annoyed by the witch&ndash;doctor’s
visit.</p>

<p>“This will unsettle every native for a week or two,”
he said, eying the man’s antics with evident disfavor.
“Those fellows are a far more enduring curse to Africa
than the gin traffic. Governments can legislate gin
out of existence, but they cannot touch ju&ndash;ju.”</p>

<p>“We are doing something in that direction here,”
said Evelyn, glancing over her shoulder at the rows
of woolly&ndash;headed little black figures in the class&ndash;room.</p>

<p>“Yes, we are educating the children, but their
parents will undo to&ndash;night all that we have accomplished
since our return. Look at Bambuk. He has
mixed with Europeans during the past ten years, yet
he is white with terror.”</p>

<p>It was an odd phrase to use with regard to a negro,
but it was quite accurate. Bambuk, interpreter,
head servant, and factotum&ndash;in&ndash;chief to the mission,
who was peering through the doorway at the proceedings
of the ju&ndash;ju man, showed every sign of alarm
when he saw the fowl&ndash;killing ceremony. His ebony
face, usually shining and jovial looking, became livid
and drawn. His eyes glistened like those of a frightened
animal.</p>

<p>Turning for a second to make sure that the children
were not listening, he drew near and whispered:</p>

<p>“Oku man make war ju&ndash;ju. Him say all black
people lib for bush, or dem King of Oku nail ebery
one to tree w’en he burn mission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Bambuk could speak far better English than that.
The fact that he had reverted so thoroughly to the
jargon of the krooboy proved the extent of his fear.</p>

<p>Hume affected to make light of the witch&ndash;doctor
and his threats.</p>

<p>“Go and tell him to stop his nonsense”, he said.
“Say I have a bale of cotton here which I brought
especially from Lagos as a present for King M’Wanga.”</p>

<p>But before Bambuk could descend the broad flight
of steps leading from the veranda, the fetish performance
was at an end and its chief actor had rushed off
among the trees.</p>

<p>Evelyn felt a chill run through her body, though
the air was hot and vapor&ndash;laden.</p>

<p>“Is M’Wagna the name of the King of Oku?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“I believe so. I have been absent nearly eight
months, as you are aware, but I haven’t heard of any
change in the local dynasty.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it likely that he has ever visited England?”</p>

<p>“Most improbable,” said Hume. “He is an absolute
savage. I have seen him only once, and I should
be sorry to think that my life depended on his good
will. But why did you imagine he might have been
in England?”</p>

<p>“Because a native of that name came there with
two others last August.”</p>

<p>“We have been visited by ju&ndash;ju men before, Charles,”
put in Mrs. Hume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. Generally they come begging for something
they want&mdash;usually drugs&mdash;which they pretend to
concoct themselves out of a snake’s liver or the gizzard
of a bird. Don’t lay too much stress on Bambuk’s
fright. He is a chicken&ndash;hearted fellow at the best.
If there is really any likelihood of a native disturbance
I shall send him with you and Miss Dane down
the river&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shall not go without you, dear,” said Mrs. Hume.</p>

<p>“Nor I&mdash;unless both of you come,” answered
Evelyn.</p>

<p>Hume laughed constrainedly.</p>

<p>“You will both obey orders, I hope,” he said, but
he did not urge the matter further at the moment.</p>

<p>They were eating their evening meal when the distant
tapping of a drum caught their ears. It was
not the rhythmical beating of a tom&ndash;tom by some
musically&ndash;inclined bushman. It much more closely
resembled the dot and dash code of the Morse alphabet,
or that variant of it which Private Thomas Atkins,
in a spasm of genius, christened “Umty&ndash;iddy.“ Heard
in the stillness of the forest, with not a breath of air
stirring the leaves of the tallest trees, and even the
tawny river murmuring in so low a note that it was
inaudible from the mission&ndash;house, this irregular drum&ndash;beating
had a depressing, almost a sinister effect.
It jarred on the nerves. It suggested the unseen and
therefore the terrible. At all costs they must find out
what it signified.</p>

<p>Bambuk was summoned. He was even more distraught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
than during the fetish performance of two
hours earlier.</p>

<p>“Dem Oku drum play Custom tune,” he explained.
“Dem Custom mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you savvy what they are saying?” broke in
Hume sharply. He did not imagine that his wife
had discussed the habits of native potentates with
her youthful helper, and even she herself did not know
the full extent of the excesses, the sheer lust of bloodshed,
hidden under a harmless&ndash;sounding word.</p>

<p>“Savvy plenty. Dem drum made of monkey&ndash;skin&mdash;p’haps
other kind of skin&mdash;an’ dem ju&ndash;ju man say:
‘Come, come! Make sharp dem knife! Come! Load
dem gun! Come, den, come! Dem ribber (river)
run red wid blood!’ Den dey nail some men to tree
an’ make dance.”</p>

<p>The missionary did not check his assistant’s recital.
It was best that the women should at least understand
the peril in which they were placed. The compound
held not more than fifty able&ndash;bodied men, and the
only arms they possessed were native weapons. Hume’s
influence depended wholly on his skill in treating the
ailments of the people and his patience in teaching
their children not only the rudiments of English but
the simpler forms of handicraft. His experience as
an African missioner was not of long standing, but
from the outset he had consistently refused to own
any firearm more deadly than a shotgun. Hitherto
he had regarded the Upper Benuë region as a settled
and fairly prosperous one. His cherished day&ndash;dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
was that before he died he might see the pioneer settlement
at Kadana transmuted into a well&ndash;equipped
college and training school, whence Christianity and
science might spread their light throughout that part
of Africa. It shocked him now to think that all his
work might be submerged under a wave of fanaticism,
yet he clung to the hope that the warlike preparations
of the men of Oku might mean nothing more serious
than a tribal quarrel. This had happened once before,
and he stepped in as arbitrator. By a liberal distribution
of presents, including the whole of the mission
stock of wine and brandy, he sent away both parties
highly gratified with both his award and his method
of arriving at it.</p>

<p>“There are war&ndash;drums beating in more than one
place,” said Evelyn, who was listening in silence to
the spasmodic tap&ndash;tap, tap&ndash;tap&ndash;tap, tap, that voiced the
dirge translated by Bambuk.</p>

<p>“Ah, you have hit on my unspoken thought,” cried
Hume. “Come, now, Bambuk, are you not enlarging
your story somewhat? Two chiefs make war&ndash;palaver;
isn’t that the explanation?”</p>

<p>“Dem Oku drum,” repeated the native, “all Oku
drum. Dey call for Custom to&ndash;night.”</p>

<p>“What exactly <i>is</i> Custom, Charles?” said Mrs.
Hume.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, it means in this instance an offering
of human sacrifice.”</p>

<p>He saw no help for it. They must know, sooner
or later, and his soul turned sick at the thought of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
wife and this gentle girl who had thrown in her lot
with theirs falling into the clutches of the fetish&ndash;maddened
bushmen. Each minute he grew more assured
that some unusual movement was taking place among
the surrounding tribes. Even to his untutored ear
there was a marked similarity in the drumming, and
he determined that the two women should go down
the river in the mission canoe as soon as the moon
rose. A crew of eight men could take them to the
nearest constabulary post, and within twenty&ndash;four hours
a steam launch would bring back an armed body of
Hausas officered by an Englishman. Till then, he
would trust to Providence for the safety of the people
under his care. That he himself could desert the
mission never entered his mind. Not only would the
settlement break up in direst confusion the moment his
back was turned, but the society’s houses and stores
would be looted and destroyed, and the work of years
swept away in a single night.</p>

<p>He was considering what excuse would serve to
get the women on board the canoe, when the splash
of paddles close at hand stirred all four to sudden
excitement. It was Bambuk who read instantly the
meaning of this unexpected sound. He rushed out,
yelling words that proved how soon the veneer of civilization
can wear off the West African negro. Soon
he came back, looking sick with fear.</p>

<p>“Dem dam pagan nigger make off in dem canoe,”
he almost screamed. “Dey savvy plenty too much
bushman lib. We all be killed one&ndash;time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Even Evelyn, new to the country and its ways,
realized what this meant. The river was their only
highway. There were native tracks in plenty through
the dense forest, but to march along any one of them
while a hostile force was lying across every path was
to court immediate disaster. By running away from
a peril which was only passive as yet, they made it
active. On the river they might escape; in the bush
they could not travel a mile except on native sufferance.</p>

<p>Hume tried bravely to minimize the force of this
unlooked&ndash;for blow. It was true the fugitives might
be expected to carry the alarm to the police post,
but until the following night it was quite impossible
for succor to reach Kadana. And now they must
all stand or fall by the mission.</p>

<p>“I did not think any of our men would be such
cowards,” he said with quiet sadness. “Let us go
and pacify the others. When all is said and done,
we have harmed no one in Oku territory, but given
relief to many who were in pain. I still believe that
this scare is unwarranted, and our presence among
our people will tend to calm them.”</p>

<p>A minute later he was sorry he had not gone alone.
Every hut in the compound was empty. Nearly two
hundred men, women, and children had fled into the
bush, preferring to obey the order of the ju&ndash;ju man
rather than defy him by remaining in the mission.
Bambuk had not been taken into their confidence
because he was originally a Foulah Mohammedan.
The colony at Kadana was precisely what Bambuk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
had called its members in his rage, for the Mohammedan
negro looks down upon his “pagan“ brethren
with supreme contempt. In a crisis such as that
which now threatened to engulf the mission, these nice
distinctions of class and creed are apt to spring into
startling prominence.</p>

<p>Hume faced the situation gallantly.</p>

<p>“Another illusion shattered,” he sighed. “Most
certainly I did not expect that all my people would
desert me at the first hint of danger. But we must
make the best of it. Even now I cannot believe that
the king of Oku&mdash;if it really is he who has created
this disturbance&mdash;can contemplate an attack on Europeans.
He has many faults, but he is not a fool,
and he knows quite well how swift and complete
would be his punishment if he interfered with us.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hume accepted her husband’s views, and
tried to look at matters with the same optimism.
Evelyn, curiously enough, was better informed than
even their native companion as to the serious nature
of the outbreak. She was convinced that Warden’s
theory was correct. Some stronger influence than a
mere tribal <i>émeute</i> lay behind those horrible drumbeats.
The authorities had been completely hoodwinked.
In her heart of hearts she feared that Kadana
shared its deadly peril that night with many a
stronger trading&ndash;post and station down the river.</p>

<p>Bambuk, quieting down from his earlier paroxysms
of fear, seemed to await his certain doom with a dignified
fatalism. Even when he heard the thud of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
paddles on the sluggish waters of the river he announced
the fact laconically.</p>

<p>“Bush man lib!” he muttered.</p>

<p>Perhaps the white faces blanched somewhat, and
hearts beat a trifle faster, but Hume alone spoke.</p>

<p>“Where?” he asked.</p>

<p>“On ribber&mdash;in dem war canoe.”</p>

<p>They strained their ears, and soon caught the measured
plashing. Then Mrs Hume began to weep.
Evelyn knelt by her side in mute sympathy. She was
too dazed to find relief in tears. For the moment she
seemed to be passing through a torturing dream from
which she would soon awake. Hume, who had gone
to the door, came to his wife.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, Mary,” he said. “That does no good&mdash;and&mdash;it
breaks my heart. I have not abandoned
hope. God can save us even yet. Be not afraid of
them that kill the body, and after that have no more
that they can do.”</p>

<p>His voice was strong and self&ndash;reliant. Even Bambuk
glanced at him with a kind of awe, and thought,
it may be, that the creed he had tried dimly to understand
was nobler than the mere stoicism that was the
natural outcome of his own fantastic beliefs. The
negro was stupid with terror, or he could not have
failed to distinguish the steady hum of an engine running
at half speed.</p>

<p>And so they waited, while the thud of the paddles
came nearer, until at last the bow of a heavy craft
crashed into the foliage overhanging the bank, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
they were rapt into a heaven of relief by hearing an
English voice.</p>

<p>“Hello, there!” it shouted. “Is this the Kadana
Mission?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hume straightway fainted, but Evelyn was
there to tend her, and Hume rushed down to the
landing&ndash;place. The gleam of a moon rising over
some low hills was beginning to make luminous the
river mist. He was able dimly to note the difference
between the pith hats of two Europeans and the smart
round caps of a number of Hausa policemen. And,
though a man of peace, he found the glint of rifle barrels
singularly comforting.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he who had spoken in the first instance,
“I am Lieutenant Colville of the constabulary, but I
have brought with me the Earl of Fairholme. Have
you a lady named Dane, Miss Evelyn Dane, staying
with you?”</p>

<p>Hume, who wanted to fall on his knees and offer
thanks to Providence, managed to say that Evelyn
Dane was certainly at Kadana at that moment.</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s the ticket!” said another voice. “I
suppose you can put us up for the night? Any sort
of shake&ndash;down will do, so long as we get away from
this beastly river. Sleepin’ on board gives one the
jim&ndash;jams, eh, what?”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pc1">WHEREIN ONE SURPRISE BEGETS MANY</p>

<p class="p2">Colville leaped ashore. Without appearing to
hurry, he was quickly by Hume’s side and asking in
an undertone:</p>

<p>“Why has this war&ndash;drumming started? I heard
it an hour ago down stream. Our engine was not running
well, so the men got the paddles to work and we
cracked on at top speed.”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said the missionary, who was
more anxious at the moment to reassure the women
than to answer questions.</p>

<p>“But is there any bush fighting going on? Everything
was reported to be all right when I left Ibi.”</p>

<p>“May heaven be praised that you were prompted
to visit us! My wife, Miss Dane, our interpreter and
myself&mdash;four out of two hundred&mdash;alone remain in
the mission. Some of our people stole the canoe and
made off, and every other native in the compound
has gone into the bush. When we heard your paddles
just now we thought that the war canoes of the King
of Oku were approaching. But please come with me
to the house. The mere sight of your uniform will
show the ladies that our danger is at an end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Colville was young, but he was old in experience.
He had also learned the exceeding wisdom of repressing
opinions that were not called for.</p>

<p>“Wait a few seconds,” he said. “Here is Lord
Fairholme. But for his urgent wish to visit Miss
Dane, we should not have been in Kadana to&ndash;night.
Hello! Who the dev&mdash;what canoe is that?”</p>

<p>Even while he was speaking, another craft shot out
from the dense layer of mist that hid the surface of
the river. Though the trees on the opposite bank
were clearly visible in the ever&ndash;spreading moonlight,
the Benuë itself was invisible. A Hausa sergeant
challenged from the launch, and the reply came in his
own tongue. A small native boat, propelled by two
paddles, grated on a strip of shingle, and an Arab and
a negro stepped ashore.</p>

<p>By this time, Fairholme had joined Colville and had
been introduced to Hume. The Arab, hardly waiting
an instant for a response to a curt inquiry, stalked
towards them. He was a tall man, gaunt but wiry,
and he carried himself with the listless air of one barely
convalescent after a severe illness.</p>

<p>But there was no trace of listlessness in his voice.
He singled out Colville immediately as the officer in
charge of the party, and addressed him in the Hausa
language.</p>

<p>“You would better bring your men ashore, run the
launch as far up the bank as possible, and barricade
yourself in the strongest building available,” he said.
“The men of Oku are out. Three of their war canoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
are stationed at the bend in the river and their occupants
are armed with Mannlicher rifles. Escape
that way is impossible. Your only chance is to hold
this post as long as Allah permits. I shall try to pass
the blockading canoes and reach Ibi, though I fear it
will be too late.”</p>

<p>Colville hardly knew at which he was most amazed,
the commanding tone of this haggard son of the desert
or the astounding news he brought.</p>

<p>“Say, then, hadji,” he cried, half ironically, “What
plague has broken out in Oku that the whole line of
the Benuë should be threatened.”</p>

<p>“The chief plague is that of blindness among officers
who fail to see the pits dug for them by crafty natives,”
was the stern answer. “I speak truly, young master.
You have half an hour, at best an hour, in which to
make preparations.”</p>

<p>“But these war canoes you speak of&mdash;they are not
at the bend; I have just come up stream.”</p>

<p>“They passed but now. You did not see them for
the mist. I accompanied them.”</p>

<p>“Why did I not hear them?”</p>

<p>“They drifted down quietly lest they should arouse
the mission.”</p>

<p>“And yet you came here? Why?”</p>

<p>“To warn the mission people. Hurry, I pray you,
and waste no time in useless talk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, Colville,” broke in Fairholme who understood
no word of this dialogue and wondered why the
English officer should permit an Arab to detain him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
“can’t Mr. Hume take me to Miss Dane? If she is
as sick of this rotten river as I am she’ll be jolly glad
to see me.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Colville. “I shall follow you
soon. This chap seems to be able to explain matters,
so I must remain here a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Hume, eager to get away, led Fairholme in the direction
of the house. The young soldier felt a strong
hand grasp his shoulder, and an English voice whispered:</p>

<p>“Colville, don’t you know me?”</p>

<p>They were standing in a cleared space where the
moonbeams gave some degree of light. The Arab
had pushed back his burnous, revealing a worn, handsome
face, tanned brown with exposure. Though
the characteristic traits of his supposed race are the
heavy lip, and the hawk&ndash;like nose, this man was
straight&ndash;nosed and thin&ndash;lipped. He was cadaverous
enough, but no Arab.</p>

<p>Colville did more than gaze, he actually gaped at
the other. There was no mistaking the cultured accent
of an English gentleman, and yet&mdash;the thing could
not be; he fancied he was bewitched.</p>

<p>“My dear Jimmie, have I changed so much, then,
since last we played snooker together in the club?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m blessed!” muttered Colville, or to be
candid, he used the subaltern’s variant of the phrase.</p>

<p>“You soon will be if you don’t do as I tell you,”
came the emphatic assurance. “But before I go, for
I must give the people at Ibi a chance&mdash;though it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
a thousand to one I shall be too late&mdash;who is the lady
your friend inquired about?”</p>

<p>Colville wanted to say so much that he found but
few words. He could only gasp:</p>

<p>“My dear Warden&mdash;didn’t you hear?”</p>

<p>“I heard her name, of course, but it cannot be a
lady of the same name in whom I was once interested.
Still, it is an odd thing it should be mentioned to&ndash;night,
and in this place. Who is she?”</p>

<p>“Oh, d&mdash;&mdash;n it all!” groaned Colville, “how could
any poor devil guess he was in for this sort of stew
when he started from Ibi yesterday!”</p>

<p>“I assure you we are wasting precious time, Jimmie.
Perhaps it is my fault, but the question was a natural
one under the circumstances. Tell your men it is all
right, or they may want to prevent my departure;
they understand those drums, you know. My only
hope of success in case I am stopped at the bend is to
keep up the pretense that I am a special envoy from the
emirs in the interior. Some day, if we win through this
business, I shall have a fine yarn for you. Good&ndash;by!”</p>

<p>“But look here, old chap, I can’t let you slip away
like that. Confound it! I don’t know what to say,
but the plain truth is best, perhaps. The girl you
were engaged to, Miss Evelyn Dane, is inside the mission&ndash;house
now, this minute, and the man I brought
from Ibi is the Earl of Fairholme. He told me all
about you on the way up. He’s a decent sort, and
he is wild over Miss Dane. But it is only fair to
add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A series of blood&ndash;curdling yells and a volley of musketry
that lit the bush with spurts of flame put an
abrupt end to Colville’s qualifying sentence. He was
so taken aback by the extraordinary coincidence that
Warden should arrive at Kadana almost at the same
instant as the man who had come there with the
avowed intent of taking Evelyn Dane home to England
as his wife, that for one bemused second he
failed to grasp the imminence or extent of the native
onslaught.</p>

<p>It was otherwise with Warden. Though his brain
might well have reeled at the words he had just heard
from a brother officer’s lips, the incessant watchfulness
demanded by the life of the past five months had
created in him a second nature. While his heart
asked tumultuous questions and found no answer to
any of them, his head dictated the steps that must
be taken if they were to offer any sort of organized
defense.</p>

<p>“Company! Attention!” he shouted. “Four men
remain with the launch, keep steam up and shove
off from the bank; all others follow to the mission.
Double&mdash;March! Beni Kalli, run the canoe ashore
and come!”</p>

<p>The loud command, proceeding apparently from
their leader, though not in their leader’s voice, was
promptly obeyed by the Hausas. They came running
across the clearing, loading their rifles and fixing
bayonets as they ran.</p>

<p>“Now, Colville, take hold!” said Warden coolly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
“I’m afraid I startled you out of your wits, but they’re
your men, not mine.”</p>

<p>The younger man needed no second bidding. Glad
of the night that hid the scarlet in his face, he told the
small squad to surround the mission&ndash;house. They
would be less visible beneath the veranda than on it.
Hume and Fairholme with two women in white dresses
had rushed out at the first sound of firing, and they
were painfully distinct in the light that came from a
large lamp inside the room at the back.</p>

<p>“Shout to them to get inside, close the doors, and
extinguish all lights,” said Warden, keeping close to
Colville during the combined rush to gain the obscurity
afforded by the heavy beams that supported the
upper story.</p>

<p>Colville obeyed. He was honestly glad that a
stronger man had taken control. His knowledge of
the country told him that a most serious and far&ndash;spread
rebellion was in progress. Rifles, not gas&ndash;pipe
guns, were in the hands of a tribe famed for its
fighting qualities. He had a dozen men, not counting
the four in the launch, to meet the onset of as many
thousands. He did not fear death, for he had faced
it many times, but it was one thing to enter on a definite
campaign, no matter what the odds, and quite
another to find himself plunged into a seemingly hopeless
fight in a time of profound peace, and at the close
of an exhausting journey undertaken to oblige a sporting
British peer.</p>

<p>He had to bellow his instructions twice before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
alarmed occupants of the mission&ndash;house quitted the
veranda. The sound of his own voice was helpful;
it steadied him. It was in his natural tone that he
growled to Warden:</p>

<p>“Fairholme admits that he is an ass, rather boasts
of it, in fact, but I thought Hume would have more
sense than to let the women stand there offering a
clear target.”</p>

<p>“They are safe enough yet,” was the reply. “Their
rooms face the river; the attack is coming from the
bush.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be better to take to the river at
once?”</p>

<p>“No, that means certain death. There are three
canoes, and each has a Nordenfeldt mounted in its
bows.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, man, a Nordenfeldt!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and M’Wanga has a dozen 12&ndash;pounders in
two batteries at Oku. Not that they will ever be of
much use to him. I took care of that. But I failed
utterly to get on board the canoes. They were moored
in mid&ndash;stream, guarded day and night, and the guns
were sheeted. Moreover, I have been out of gear
nearly six weeks. This is a big business, Colville.
How is it no one knew of what was going on?”</p>

<p>“There were rumors, but they died down.
Forbes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Did they send Forbes in my place?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That explains it. He is a capital fellow in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
office. To ask him to unravel an Oku plot was to
set a bat catching sparrows by daylight.”</p>

<p>They had plenty of time to discuss matters thus
coolly. No West African fighting&ndash;man would demean
himself by delivering an assault on an enemy’s position
without a preliminary hubbub of yells and wild shooting.
It is different when he is the defender. Then
he will lie close as a partridge till the precise moment
that his usually antiquated guns can most effectually
belch forth a destroying blast of nails, iron
scraps, pebbles, and broken glass and pottery.</p>

<p>But the seconds passed, and the minutes, and no
horde of demoniac figures poured across the open
compound. The shooting was incessant, yet no bullet
struck the house, though not even an indifferent native
marksmen could well avoid hitting a big building
in which all the living&ndash;rooms were on the same floor
as the veranda. The lower part of the structure
served as a store.</p>

<p>The Hausa soldier&ndash;policemen, picked men of the
West African Regiment, were trained not to fire without
orders. They were far too few in number to line
the stockade, which enclosed a space fully two acres
in extent. In any case, the defense it afforded was
worse than useless. The gates were jammed open
by a year’s growth of herbage. In some instances, a
passage had been made by the simple expedient of
removing a whole section. It would demand many
hours of labor by a hundred men to put the palisade
in a serviceable condition. Hume’s effort was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
establish a mission, not a fort, in this jungle outpost.</p>

<p>The Hausa sergeant was puzzled in more ways than
one. He heard his officer talking English to an Arab,
he heard the unmistakable crackling of rifles fully
equal to those with which he and the others were armed,
and he was unable to account for the delay in the
attack.</p>

<p>Enjoining on his men the necessity of keeping well
within the shadow, he crept along close to the wall
until he stood by Colville’s side. He was about to ask
permission to make a reconnaissance, and thus force
the enemy to reveal themselves, when an incident almost
without precedent in bush warfare took place.</p>

<p>The indiscriminate firing stopped, the wild&ndash;beast
noises died away into absolute silence, and a strip of
white cotton suddenly became visible in one of the
many gaps in the stockade. It was held stationary
for a moment, then a native warrior stepped boldly
forth into the moonlight. His magnificent physique
was enhanced by the war trappings that decked his
head, breast, and loins, and he strode forward with
the lithe movements of a man in perfect training.
When he entered the compound, it was seen that he
carried a white flag on a lance. He meant to parley,
and such a departure from the savage methods of a
semi&ndash;cannibal tribe was hitherto unheard of. Usually,
an unprotected party of Europeans, whether
missionaries or traders, are butchered without mercy
if found within the zone of tribal foray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“By gad,” muttered Colville, “they’re going to
offer terms!”</p>

<p>“I think I can guess what the terms will be,” said
Warden. “There’s a woman in the case, Jimmie&mdash;something
new in a bush campaign, eh?”</p>

<p>The subaltern did not understand the curious undertone
of grim irony in the remark; but he was aware of
it and made no reply. The black warrior had halted.
His wonderfully developed sense of hearing warned
him that some one not in the house was speaking,
and the voices could come from no other place than
the gloomy recess beneath the veranda.</p>

<p>“O Hume!” he cried loudly. “I fit for palaver.”</p>

<p>Colville half expected that Warden would answer
for Hume. He was mistaken. His senior leaned
back against the wall of the store, and folded his
arms with the air of a man who meant to abide
by a settlement in whose discussion he can take no
part.</p>

<p>The negro, though trusting to his vague conception
of a code of honor that he associated with fighting
against white men, came no nearer.</p>

<p>“O Hume!” he cried again, “open dem door one&ndash;time,
an’ hear what I fit for say.”</p>

<p>In the strange hush succeeding the frenzied uproar
that announced the presence of a host of armed natives,
the envoy’s words were clearly audible to the
five people in the upper rooms. Hume came out,
followed by Bambuk.</p>

<p>“Who are you and what do you want?” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
missionary. “Why do you come to me at night, and
threaten the lives of my friends and myself in this
manner?”</p>

<p>“I done tell you if Bambuk lib. I no fit for long
palaver.”</p>

<p>At this, the interpreter leaned over the rail of the
veranda.</p>

<p>“You are Loanda, I think?” he said, using the
vernacular.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply. “Tell the white man that
the lives of himself and his wife will be spared, and
they will be taken in safety to the frontier, if the English
girl now in their house is handed over to us at
once. She, too, will be well treated. One whom she
knows, Miguel Figuero, awaits her at Oku. He is
our friend, so she need have no fear. I, Loanda, say
it, and that which I say is done.”</p>

<p>Bambuk translated this astounding request literally.
Evelyn heard every word, and she alone grasped their
terrible import. She appeared in the doorway, white&ndash;faced,
with eyes that terror had made almost distraught.</p>

<p>“Miguel Figuero!” repeated the bewildered Hume.
“Isn’t that the name of the Portuguese rascal you have
told us of, Miss Dane?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, and her voice was tense with the
effort to keep it from breaking. “He is in league with
the men of Oku. I knew it, and Captain Warden
warned the authorities at home about him, but no one
here would listen. Oh, Mr. Hume, it is a dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
thing to say, but rather than fall into that man’s power
I would kill myself.”</p>

<p>“You surely don’t imagine that we would agree to
those terms, do you?”</p>

<p>Hume was almost indignant, but Evelyn flung herself
on her knees and lifted her clasped hands in agony
to the star&ndash;studded sky.</p>

<p>“What else can I do?” she wailed. “My life is
broken. I have nothing left to live for. If I refuse
this offer of peace, it means that all your lives are
forfeit&mdash;yours and your wife’s, and Lord Fairholme’s,
and those of the officer and men who came here in the
launch from Ibi. Tell him I agree. I will go to this
man. But make the chief promise to spare you and
the others. I must know first that you are safe. Then&mdash;O
God, pardon me!&mdash;then&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My dear girl&mdash;which of us would purchase a few
more hours of life at such a price?”</p>

<p>“But you do not understand,” she blazed forth.
“If the death of one can save many why shouldn’t the
one die? We can’t hope to resist these men; there
are thousands of them. And unless I fall by my own
hand, they may capture me unharmed after you have
given your lives uselessly in my defense. Oh, pity me
and pray for me, but do not let me be responsible for
the slaughter of the few friends I possess in the world!”</p>

<p>She could no longer restrain her tears. The dark
blue dome that typified the heaven to which she looked
for mercy was blotted out of sight. She cowered as
though from a blow, and wept pitifully. Then a voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
rang out from the compound directly in front of where
she knelt. As the opening syllables reached her ears,
though she understood no word that was uttered, her
surcharged brain harbored a new dread, for the man
who was speaking spoke in Warden’s voice&mdash;Warden,
whom she had learned to regard as dead these months
past. Of course, grief and fear had driven her mad!
She swept away the tears that blurred her vision, and
peered through the rails of the veranda, but she saw
only a cloaked Arab who had stepped forth into the
moonlight, and was now addressing stern warnings to
the amazed Loanda. And fantasy played her distracted
senses another strange trick. The face of the
native chief was plainly visible. She watched its
expression change from sheer wonderment to baffled
rage, and it seemed to her that it was not Loanda who
glowered at the Arab who harangued him, but the
scowling mask carved on the gourd by Domenico
Garcia.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, she was truly mad. She realized it herself,
but the others would never suspect it. Then the persistence
of the notion brought relief to her aching
heart. A kindly delirium might carry her through the
ordeal that lay before her. She no longer feared
insanity, rather did she welcome it, and now was her
chance to act while she was brave and would not flinch
from that which she conceived was her duty.</p>

<p>But why was that tall Arab still talking in Warden’s
voice, and why did the stalwart savage seem to threaten
him with furious gesture? Even while she was gazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
between the wooden bars of the railing, she saw
Loanda grasp his spear menacingly, whereupon the
Arab laughed&mdash;how like it was to Warden’s laugh
of good&ndash;natured raillery!&mdash;and a couple of Hausa
soldiers appeared, with rifles held suggestively, as men
hold shotguns when they expect a rabbit to scuttle out
of a spinney.</p>

<p>Again, being still under the spell of that sudden
lunacy, she heard the Arab say in English, and more
amazingly than ever in Warden’s very tones:</p>

<p>“Now, Jimmie! Four paces to the front in open
order&mdash;every man&mdash;quick!”</p>

<p>An English officer and several soldiers came out into
the open. After one glance of sheer astonishment, the
Oku chief turned and stalked away towards the bush.
He did not deign to hurry, but his lithe springy gait
soon carried him into the somber shadows. The
dramatic silence that followed was broken by the man
in an officer’s uniform.</p>

<p>“By gad, Warden, you did that splendidly,” he said.
“I should never have thought of it. Do you think it
will work?”</p>

<p>“For to&ndash;night, perhaps. One never knows just how
the native mind will look at a thing. It gave Loanda
a positive shock when he was really convinced that
a British officer was not only present at most of
M’Wanga’s war palavers, but had thrown out of gear
every field gun in his precious battery. He would not
tell me where M’Wanga is now, but I hardly think
they will attack us in earnest before consulting him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“I am inclined to believe you have knocked the
bottom out of the whole bally business,” said Colville
jubilantly. “They are scared to death of you, Warden.
You are the first man who had the opportunity to bust
up the Oku ju&ndash;ju, and, by Jove, didn’t you take it?”</p>

<p>But Colville was wrong. The weird hoot of an owl
came from the bush, a drum tapped out a signal, and
instantly the forest became alive with vivid jets of
light. The negroes had begun their fusillade again,
and this time they meant to kill, not to frighten. Bullets
whistled past the house, imbedded themselves in
the stout timbers, tore huge splinters from beams,
and hurled shingles from the roof. It seemed to be a
miracle that every person in or near the building was
not struck instantly, but the opening volley sent the
Hausas to cover beneath the veranda, where they were
told to lie flat on the ground behind the protecting
supports. To reply to the enemy’s fire would be
merely a waste of precious ammunition, and the men
carried only a small quantity in their bandoliers. The
time to fire was when every shot would be effective.
Rarely will untrained savages press home an attack
when their foremost warriors fall. The Hausas,
negroes themselves, had been taught this in many a
bush skirmish, and they had absolute confidence in
their white leaders, for, by this time, the rumor had
gone round that the man in Arab clothing was the
well&ndash;known deputy commissioner of the Brass River,
under whom some of them had fought in the sister
protectorate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Hume, who was cool as any soldier, seized Evelyn’s
arm the instant that the first bullet crashed into the
woodwork. Fairholme, too, who had recovered from
the stupefying suddenness of what was, to him, a wholly
unexpected sequel to a wearisome trip up a fever&ndash;laden
river, ran forward to help, and the two men half
carried the girl to the protection of the house.</p>

<p>But she had no thought of danger. Though it was
dark inside the main living&ndash;room, she held them fast
when they would have released her, and tried to read
their very souls by a look.</p>

<p>“Did you hear?” she gasped. “That man&mdash;the
Arab&mdash;who is he?... The other called him Warden....
Why should he do that?... Was it not cruel of
him?... And why, why, did it seem to me that I
heard Arthur’s voice?”</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, Miss Dane,” said the missionary
quietly. “Providence at times adopts means not
within mortal ken. I could not follow what was said
to Loanda, but Bambuk tells me that, by some astounding
chance, Captain Arthur Warden has not only
crossed a large part of Africa, but has lived many
weeks in Oku itself, and is now taking measures which
will, I trust, by God’s mercy, secure our safety.”</p>

<p>A queer choking cry came from the girl’s parched
throat.</p>

<p>“Then I am not mad?” she murmured. “He is
really there! And he heard what I said&mdash;when&mdash;when
I offered to go to Figuero?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course he heard. It seemed to me it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
on your account that he made himself known to the
chief. But I do not yet understand exactly what
happened. I only know that when first he spoke to
Colville he used Arabic.”</p>

<p>“Yes, by gad,” put in Fairholme, finding an opening
at last. “I thought he was a beastly native, an’ I
cut in like a bloomin’ ass. Just my usual luck, Evelyn.
The favorite got up in the last stride an’ pipped
the outsider by a short head, eh, what?”</p>

<p>The earl’s happy&ndash;go&ndash;lucky method of expressing
himself was singularly out of tune with his surroundings.
Hume had closed the door, and the windows
were already shuttered, so the darkness was now that
of Pharaoh’s Egypt when Moses stretched forth his
hand towards heaven. From without came the incessant
crackling of musketry, and the maniacal howlings
of negroes inspiring each other for the ultimate
hand&ndash;to&ndash;hand fight; within, one heard the hysterical
sobbing of Mrs. Hume, the mutterings of the Foulah
servant, and the patter of small débris from walls and
roof as the building shook under the sledge&ndash;hammer
blows of bullets traveling at a high velocity. Luckily,
as Warden had pointed out, the front of the mission&ndash;house
faced the river, and there was no firing from
that quarter as yet. The veranda was approached by
a double staircase which mounted from each side and
met at a small landing, whence half a dozen steps led
to the level of the upper floor. As both sections of
the stairs projected beyond the line of the building,
their comparatively thin boards were being constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
ripped and split by the leaden missiles that hurtled in
from both flanks.</p>

<p>It was spinning a coin with death for any one to
descend either to right or left, yet that is what Evelyn
did when Lord Fairholme’s bizarre explanation brought
her back to the world which she had already quitted
in imagination. Owing to the tomb&ndash;like blackness of
the room, neither man was aware of her intent until
the door was opened and she was speeding down the
shattered stairs.</p>

<p>In her white dress she was a most conspicuous object.
A pent&ndash;house roof shielded the stairs from sun and
rain, but the moment she emerged into the moonlit
compound she resembled some ethereal creature sent
by the gods to still the wretched strife waged by foolish
men. And, spirit&ndash;like, she passed unscathed through
the hissing and biting rain of lead. She had but one
thought, and it fluttered tremulously from her lips.</p>

<p>“Arthur!” she wailed, “Arthur! I am here!”</p>

<p>And again, “Arthur! Come to me! Why don’t
you speak?... It is I, Evelyn.... Where are you?
Oh, Arthur dear, answer me.”</p>

<p>Warden was lying by Colville’s side behind a main
pillar at an angle of the house when he heard the girl’s
rapt cry. Turning on an elbow, he saw her flitting
past. He was up in an instant. Without spoken
word he leaped out and clasped her in his arms.</p>

<p>Colville rose too.</p>

<p>“Oh, good Lord!” he muttered, “they will both be
killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>!”</p>

<p>But fate had chosen for Warden a strange path to a
woman’s love, and the fickle goddess shielded him
now when he, all a&ndash;quiver with the thrill of holding
Evelyn in his arms, clasped her tightly and ran with
her up the rickety stairs. Even as he hurried to place
her in shelter the bushmen had seen the white&ndash;robed
apparition and concentrated their fire in that direction.
Bullets spat against the ground, crashed through the
flimsy wooden structure, and pierced their clothing
many times&mdash;but neither was injured. A few seconds
after she had passed through the door Evelyn was
carried back again. But it was a fitting outcome of
the madness that had fallen on the quiet mission&ndash;station
that she should be blithely heedless of the
mortal peril which both she and her lover had escaped.
Even while death was missing them by a hair’s breadth,
she began to tell Warden in broken phrases how she
had never faltered in her belief that he would one day
be restored to her, and that she had come to Africa
and the Benuë strong in the conviction that they would
meet there and nowhere else in the wide world.</p>

<p>All of this, and more, was delightfully inaccurate,
but Evelyn believed it and the man who listened
believed it, and love was more potent than cold reason,
so cold reason was barred out among the shrieking
hail of lead that had failed to secure its victims.</p>

<p>Yet their idyll was soon cut short. A red glare
became visible through the chinks of door and windows,
and Warden knew what it meant.</p>

<p>“They have set fire to the native huts,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
“They want to see where our men are stationed before
they try a rush. I must go, sweetheart. Kiss me!
If it is good&ndash;by, I shall die content, for I have passed
through much tribulation ere this divine moment was
vouchsafed.”</p>

<p>Not for all the gold in Africa would she prove herself
unworthy of him in that supreme moment.</p>

<p>“Go, then!” she said. “Whether in life or death
we shall not be separated again.”</p>

<p>Warden was at the door when some one sprang
after him. In the growing light of the burning buildings
he recognized Colville’s companion in the launch.</p>

<p>“I suppose I can count for one in the scrum,” said
the stranger. “Evelyn promised to be my sister, old
chap, an’ before we all go under I’ll d&mdash;&mdash;n well down
a nigger or two for the sake of the family. Can you
spare a gun? I’m a good man at driven birds, an’
these black jokers are several sizes bigger than blackcock&mdash;eh,
what?”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pc1">A FIVE MINUTES’ FIGHT</p>

<p class="p2">Fairholme was soon equipped with a rifle. He
was crouching behind a wooden pillar close to Warden
and Colville, when a Hausa who had incautiously
exposed himself uttered a queer cough and pitched
forward on his face, shot through the lungs. The earl
took the man’s gun and bandolier, but noticed that
none of the others were firing, though a number of
black forms were dimly visible through the murk
created by the smoke of the blazing huts.</p>

<p>Warden was watching him.</p>

<p>“You will soon get busy,” he said. “They are
preparing for a rush. Pick out the leaders, the fellows
wearing the gaudiest feathers, or carrying a leopard&ndash;skin
slung across their shoulders.”</p>

<p>“You’re a funny lookin’ bird yourself,” chuckled
Fairholme. “What price you for the Kingdom Come
stakes when the niggers spot you? Every black son
of a gun will want to add you to the bag.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Warden,” put in Colville anxiously.
“Chuck away that burnous, and stick on poor
Toomba’s cap. Fairholme can pull it in with the
clearing&ndash;rod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Warden. “My Arab’s livery has served
me in good stead thus far. I shall not abandon it
until I can borrow the togs of civilization, if ever I
need them. Hello, here they come!”</p>

<p>A slackening in the fusillade and a terrific outburst
of yells showed that the enemy were breaking cover in
force. In an instant the compound seemed to become
alive with armed negroes, many of whom had already
discarded their modern rifles for the more familiar
matchet and spear.</p>

<p>Colville shouted something in the Hausa tongue,
and his men, all but two, leaped to their feet. Firing
with deadly accuracy at such a short range, they brought
down a score of the foremost savages. Fairholme,
imbued with the traditions of European warfare,
naturally expected that the attack would be pressed
home, so he set his teeth and resolved to enter the
next world with a royal bodyguard. Remembering
Warden’s instructions, he looked only for the most
gorgeously decorated warriors, and found three including
Loanda himself. Warden, who had secured the
rifle of the second wounded Hausa, saw the earl bowl
over a ju&ndash;ju man at sixty yards, no mean shooting at
night in an atmosphere rapidly becoming smoke&ndash;laden.</p>

<p>“Well done, brother&ndash;in&ndash;law!” he cried, and in the
throes of that deadly strife those two began a friendship
not to be severed on this side of the great boundary.
As the house was attacked simultaneously on three
sides, Colville ran around it to tell each member of
his tiny force to fall back on the staircase when hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
pressed. The instruction was given not a second too
soon. Trusting to their great numbers, the men of
Oku came on boldly. They were first&ndash;rate soldiers in
their own way, they anticipated an easy victory, and
they were filled with the frenzied desire to use steel
rather than lead. That is the bushman’s temperament;
killing loses half its ferocious joy if he cannot
“paint“ his weapon. This sheer lust of blood now
served the little garrison in good stead. True, it exposed
them to the combined onslaught of hundreds of
sinewy negroes, but it saved them from the speedy
extermination that must have been their lot were their
assailants content to shoot them down at close quarters.
In less than a minute after the stockade was passed
by the enemy, Warden, Colville, Fairholme, Beni
Kalli&mdash;who used an adze he stumbled across in the
doorway of the store&mdash;the Hausa sergeant, and seven
of the rank and file&mdash;twelve men all told&mdash;were in
a half circle around the foot of the stairs, plying rifle
and bayonet on a wall of black humanity. The very
strength of the attacking force placed it at a disadvantage.
The men in front were hindered by those
who surged up in ever&ndash;increasing waves from the
rear. Every shot fired by the defenders effected losses
out of all proportion to the general run of wounds
inflicted by musketry even in a hand&ndash;to&ndash;hand engagement.
Though the wretched warriors who bore the
brunt of the assault might have escaped bullet or butt
or bayonet thrust, there was no dodging the withering
blasts of powder which blinded and scorched them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and smote their naked limbs with strange buffets.
The eerie yells of those who thought the mission had
already fallen mingled with the screams of the wounded
and the groans of the dying. The place reeked like a
slaughter&ndash;house, and the corpses of those who were
killed outright, or the maimed and writhing men who
had sustained injuries which rendered them incapable
of crawling out of that packed space, formed a veritable
rampart around the defenders.</p>

<p>At this stage the loss of a skilled leader like Loanda
made itself felt among his followers. He would either
have set fire to the unprotected rear of the building
or drawn off a part of his force and renewed the shooting
from a flank. Any such diversion by a tithe of
the warriors engaged would render the position immediately
untenable by the three white men and the
Hausas. When, at last, the flanking maneuver was
attempted by half a dozen negroes who had extricated
themselves unharmed from the press beneath the overhanging
roof of the stairs, the disastrous effect of their
strategy showed what might have been accomplished
but for the smallness of their number. Colville fell,
and the Hausa sergeant, and two men. A bullet
plowed through Warden’s hair, and another ripped
Fairholme’s coat and shirt, and grazed his breast, and
these casualties resulted before the few men attempting
the enfilade had fired two rounds per rifle.</p>

<p>Warden, alive to a danger that promised instant
collapse, slung Colville across his shoulder and gave
the order that the few who remained alive should fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
back, still fighting steadily, until they had mounted
the double stairs and gained the veranda.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in his mind that the end had
come. His surprise had failed. He had hoped that
the unexpected presence of the Hausas and a party of
white people might damp the ardor of the men of Oku,
who had looked forward to securing an easy prey in
the mission, and who could not possibly have anticipated
a stubborn resistance by troops whom they
had learned to fear. In ninety&ndash;nine cases out of a
hundred his belief would have been justified. That
there was an exception now arose from the fact that
the tribal witch&ndash;doctors had made much of the modern
arms which the tribesmen possessed.</p>

<p>“You have the white man’s fetish,” they declared.
“Hitherto our ju&ndash;ju has not prevailed against them.
To&ndash;day you are invulnerable.”</p>

<p>Under European leaders this mistaken logic would
not have caused a reversion to the method of combined
attack so dear to the native warrior. Loanda and
some of his lieutenants had already displayed their
shrewdness by harping constantly on the necessity of
depending more on the rifle and less on spear or matchet.
They would never have permitted an advance in force
if they were not certain of their ability to overpower
the weak detachment of Hausas at the first rush. In
a sense, it was Evelyn’s presence which brought about
this decision. Their Portuguese ally had made such
a point of her capture uninjured that they wished to
gratify him, while there were other forcible reasons
why they should not waste too many hours on the
siege of a paltry place like the mission station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the struggle thus far was short and sharp,
the unhappy people within the walls were only too
conscious of its developments. To their strained
senses it seemed that at any moment the door must
be burst open and they swept into the clutches of
merciless savages. They could not tell who was
living or dead. The incessant shooting and the howls
and agonized cries of the negroes drowned all other
sounds. Evelyn thought she heard Warden addressing
some order to the Hausas, but she could not be sure.
Hume, in whom the man was rapidly supplanting the
missioner, wished to take a personal share in the defense,
but his wife clung to him in an agony of terror,
and implored him not to leave her. While trying to
soothe the distracted woman he reflected that he would
probably prove more of a hindrance than otherwise in
the fighting line. If he used a gun at all it must be
as a cudgel, for he did not even understand the mechanism
of the breech&ndash;block.</p>

<p>Bambuk, though a Mohammedan and a Foulah,
was no longer a fighting man. He had waxed fat and
prosperous, and he waited now for death with the
fatalism he had displayed ever since he knew for certain
that the men of Oku were bent on looting Kadana.</p>

<p>Evelyn, leaning against the door, with every faculty
on the alert for the slightest indication of Warden’s
welfare, nevertheless let her mind stray in the most
bewildering manner. She was devoid of fear. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
given her choice, she would be out there in the thick
of the struggle, using her puny strength on behalf of
the man she loved. Instead, she was condemned to
inaction. The intolerable darkness became oppressive,
and her memory flew back through time and space to
the sunlit day when she sat with Warden and Peter
Evans in the little dinghy of the <i>Nancy</i>, and saw the
grim face of the Oku chief dancing about on the blue
waters of the Solent.</p>

<p>What a trivial incident it was in some respects&mdash;yet
what a mighty upheaval it portended! No matter
in what direction her whirling thoughts took her, the
carved calabash seemed to be mixed up with events in
a way that was hardly credible. It brought her and
Warden together. That chance meeting on a summer
morning gave them a bond of interest which quickly
strengthened into affection and love. Then it led
them into the intricacies of a political plot, sent Warden
to London, caused him to encounter Mrs. Laing,
with all the heartache and misery that resulted therefrom,
and cast him ashore at Rabat to become a slave
and a desert wanderer. She herself had been equally
its sport. Her knowledge of the men of Oku alone
induced Figuero and Baumgartner to conspire against
her. If she had never seen the gourd it was more
than probable that she would never have gazed on the
Benuë River. And how persistently that weird creation
of Domenico Garcia’s skill had clung to either
Warden or herself. It was not to be shaken off. Even
now, when they were on the very threshold of death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
it was lying there in her room, shrouded in a canvas
case. She could almost see its evil scowl everlastingly
threatening mankind.</p>

<p>Though a fresh outburst of firing startled her highly
strung nerves she felt somewhat of a thrill of supernatural
awe at the fancy that the carved image of the
by&ndash;gone King of Benin had forced its way back to the
actual locality in which its human prototype had ruled
millions of those very men who were now clamoring
for the lives of herself and her companions.</p>

<p>It was a strange notion, and it dominated her for a
moment to the exclusion of all else. Could it be possible
that there were subtle forces at work of whose
existence she was wholly unaware? Had these unhappy
blacks some power at command which was
denied to those who lorded it over them? Of late she
had read a good deal concerning the supposed origin
of Obi rites in West African fetish&ndash;worship. She had
never seen a real ju&ndash;ju man until that afternoon, but
his appearance and antics were sufficiently striking to
create a vivid impression quite apart from the tragic
sequel to his incantation. The queer belief that the
calabash was in some degree responsible for the bloodshed
going on within a few feet of where she stood so
took hold of her that she found the continued darkness
unbearable.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hume,” she said, forcing her parched lips to
utter the words, “don’t you think the lamp might be
lit now? It cannot make much difference. We are
nearing the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>For reply Hume struck a match, and applied it to
the wick. The comfortable and spacious room suddenly
assumed its familiar guise. It looked quiet and
home&ndash;like. The turmoil raging beneath seemed to
be absurdly incongruous&mdash;a horrible dream rather
than a dread reality.</p>

<p>Yet the lamp was hardly well alight ere Warden’s
voice came from the veranda.</p>

<p>“Open the door, Hume!” he cried. “Colville is
wounded!”</p>

<p>Evelyn, owing to her nearness, flung wide the door
before the missionary could reach it. Warden stood
there, ghastly to behold, but still apparently free from
any grave injury. His left arm encircled Colville’s
limp body, and in his right hand was a gun&ndash;barrel
from which the stock had been broken off. In his
Arab costume, travel&ndash;soiled and blood&ndash;stained, he
looked the incarnation of fearsome war, while the
seemingly lifeless form he carried added a note of
horror to his appalling aspect.</p>

<p>But when he saw Evelyn he actually smiled. She
caught the tender look in his eyes through the mask
of blood and dirt and perspiration.</p>

<p>“I fear it is all up with us, sweetheart,” he said.
“I don’t think Colville is dead, but it is only a matter
of seconds for him and the rest of us. Have you a
revolver? Give me that lamp. It may help a little.
Under this low roof we cannot distinguish friend from
foe.”</p>

<p>He spoke so gently, with such well&ndash;balanced modulation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
that he might have been standing at the door
of some peaceful villa overlooking the Thames, with
no more serious purport in his words than to light the
way for a guest. But a rush and a furious melee
on the stairs showed what manner of guest might be
expected, and that ominous question anent a revolver
was not lost on Evelyn. Hume took Colville into his
arms, and Warden, without waiting for the lamp,
turned to reinforce the five men who now held the
enemy at bay.</p>

<p>The girl, with a Berserk courage worthy of her
ancestry, snatched up the lamp and ran with it to the
veranda. Attached to a pillar at the head of the stairs
was a bracket on which a light was placed each night
in the rainy season to attract the insects that would
otherwise invade the house. She put the lamp there,
and stole one awestricken glance at the furious conflict
raging on both sides of the lower landing. A
bullet, fired from a muzzle&ndash;loader, sang past her face.
She almost wished that a truer aim had found heart
or brain, because then she would be spared the affrighting
alternative suggested by Warden. If she did not
die by her own hand, would the men of Oku kill her?
She feared they would not!</p>

<p>For an instant the rays of the lamp enabled the
defense to beat back the first surge of what must surely
be the final and successful assault. A gigantic native,
whom she did not know&mdash;but who was swinging an
adze in fine style by Warden’s side, turned and gazed
at her. It was Beni Kalli, Warden’s negro companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
in the escape from Lektawa, and now his most devoted
henchman. He had seldom seen a white woman, and
never one in any way resembling Evelyn. To his
untutored mind, she was a spirit.</p>

<p>“Now, may Allah be praised!” he cried joyfully,
“we shall whip these dogs of pagans back to their
swamp, for mine eyes have seen one of the lily maids
who tend the Prophet’s flock in Paradise.”</p>

<p>Warden, who thought his gigantic retainer had
gone fey, looked around and found that Evelyn was
immediately behind him, though on a slightly higher
level. She was standing in a most perilous position.
There was a space of at least three feet between the
lower edge of the main roof and the slight scantling
that protected the staircase from the tremendous
rainstorms of the tropics, and any one standing a little
way back from the house could not fail to see her.
He forgot the heartbroken advice he had just given
her. He realized only that the woman he loved was
in mortal peril.</p>

<p>“Go back!” he shouted. “For God’s sake, go in
and bolt the door! You will be shot from the compound!”</p>

<p>A negro leaped round the corner of the stairs and
struck at him with a matchet. Beni Kalli was just in
time to parry the blow. Then the adze whirled, and
buried itself in the man’s skull. Before it could be
withdrawn a spear darted up viciously, but Warden’s
broken rifle diverted the thrust and a Hausa got his
bayonet home. Nevertheless, a dozen more negroes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
were forcing their way up on both sides. Fairholme,
valiant little aristocrat, was borne down and fell,
utterly exhausted, at Evelyn’s feet. A Hausa was
shot through the head and dropped across Fairholme’s
body. Three men, Warden, Beni Kalli, and a Hausa,
now alone held at bay the human wolves who saw
victory within their grasp.</p>

<p>Evelyn refused to re&ndash;enter the house. She meant
to die there by her lover’s side. Why did not merciful
death come quickly? It would be better if she passed
before him. She breathed a prayer that God would
vouchsafe this grace, for her woman’s heart revolted
from the thought that she should see him killed. In
a very trance of hope that her wish might be granted,
she looked into the moonlit compound and stretched
out her arms pitifully, for she well knew that while
Warden lived no kindly spear or native sword would
free her soul for that eternal meeting.</p>

<p>But the men of Oku were running, running for their
lives and throwing away their cherished rifles, lest
they should not be able to run fast enough. Through
the drifting smoke of the burning huts and the haze
now spreading up the bank from the river, she saw
little squads of dark&ndash;clothed Hausas rushing in pursuit
of the flying blacks. Greatest marvel of all,
scattered among the Hausas were a number of British
sailors. There was no mistaking their uniforms or
the exceeding zest with which they entered into the
last phase of a first&ndash;rate fight.</p>

<p>When the wondrous fact that succor was at hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
penetrated the ecstasy of that mute appeal to death,
she did not cry it aloud to Warden. Not only would
she imperil both him and his two companions by distracting
their attention from the cut&ndash;and&ndash;thrust combat
on the stairs, but, sad to relate of a tender&ndash;hearted
girl, she found a delirious satisfaction in watching the
sweep of gun&ndash;barrel and adze and the wicked plunging
of the Hausa bayonet. Why should not these ravening
beasts be punished? What harm had she or any one
in the mission done them that they should howl so
frantically for their blood?</p>

<p>But she prayed&mdash;oh, how she prayed!&mdash;that the
relieving force would hurry. She could not tell that
officers and men of the white contingent were astounded
by the spectacle of a slight, girlish figure, robed in
muslin and seemingly in no fear of her life, standing
under the bright rays of a lamp on the veranda of the
beleaguered mission&ndash;house. It did not occur to her
that they would see her; and, simply because she was
there, they by no means expected to find a desperate
fight being waged in the narrow space of the staircase.
But they soon woke up to the facts when the foremost
man came near enough to discover the black figures
wedged in both gangways.</p>

<p>“Come on!” he yelled. “This is what we’re looking
for!”</p>

<p>“No shooting, boys!” roared a jubilant naval lieutenant.
“Bayonets only! Dig ‘em out!”</p>

<p>And dug out they were, in a manner not prescribed
by the drill book, until the passages were clear, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the newcomers were marveling at the way in which
the mission&ndash;house was held, and Warden was free to
lay aside that useful gun&ndash;barrel and stoop to lift the
dead Hausa off Fairholme’s almost breathless body.</p>

<p>The officer, who was first up the stairs, looked round
for some one in authority. He saw an Arab and a
girl supporting a white man between them. To his
profound amazement, he heard the Arab say:</p>

<p>“He is all right, dear. Those cuts are superficial,
just like my own. But he is thoroughly spent. I
am almost at the end of my own tether, though I was
hard as nails till that wretched fever bowled me over
in Oku.”</p>

<p>“But, Arthur darling,” he was even more astounded
at hearing from the girl’s lips, “where have the troops
come from? What special decree of Providence brought
them to our rescue?”</p>

<p>“Here is some one who can tell us?” said Warden,
looking at the lieutenant, while he placed Fairholme
on a chair in the living&ndash;room.</p>

<p>“May I ask who you are?” demanded the sailor,
finding his tongue but slowly.</p>

<p>“My name is Warden, Captain Arthur Warden, of
the Southern Nigeria Protectorate&mdash;and yours?”</p>

<p>“Warden! Are you in earnest?”</p>

<p>“Never more so. Won’t you follow my example?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m Bellairs, of the <i>Valiant</i>.”</p>

<p>“Did Captain Mortimer send you?” cried Evelyn,
who was mightily afraid that the moment she spoke
she would burst into tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well&mdash;yes. You are Miss Dane, I suppose?
And this is Lord Fairholme. Is poor Colville gone?”</p>

<p>“Not very far,” said a weak voice from an inner
room. “My collar&ndash;bone is broken and I’ve lost chips
off several sections, but I’ll be able to shove along
with my arm in a sling.”</p>

<p>“Has anybody got any liquor?” murmured another
weak voice from a chair. “I don’t care what it is&mdash;even
water. I’ve got a thirst I wouldn’t sell for a
pony.”</p>

<p>Hume, who had fallen on his knees when he heard
the strange voices, and looked out to find that the
battle was ended, rose and went to a cupboard.</p>

<p>“I have here two quarts of champagne which I
meant to keep for cases of serious illness,” he said.
“I don’t think any of us will ever be so near death
again until the scythe&ndash;bearer comes and will not be
denied, so if any of you gentlemen are expert at opening
these bottles&mdash;“</p>

<p>Fairholme recovered instantly.</p>

<p>“Hand one here,” he gasped. “I’m a double blue
at drawin’ corks and emptyin’ a bottle of bubbly.”</p>

<p>Hume, who had lighted a second lamp, produced
some glasses. Then he glanced at a clock.</p>

<p>“Can it be possible that all this dreadful business
has lasted only four minutes?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Four minutes!” cried the sailor. “Why, we heard
firing in this direction nearly twenty minutes ago!”</p>

<p>“That was the first round, when the blacks tried to
frighten us into submission,” said Warden. “But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
now that I come to think of it, the scrap itself cannot
have occupied many seconds more than your estimate,
Hume.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that you five accounted
for that heap of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at Evelyn and Mrs. Hume.
The latter was striving to dry her eyes while she sipped
some of the wine. Poor lady! She was not cast in
the heroic mold, nor had she ever pretended to be.</p>

<p>“There were more than five of us,” explained
Warden sadly. “Eleven of Colville’s Hausas are
down.”</p>

<p>“Some of them can only be wounded,” said Evelyn.
“Let us go and attend to them.”</p>

<p>“Better not, Miss Dane,” interposed the sailor
hastily. He had seen things in the compound which
rendered it advisable for the women to remain indoors
until the river crocodiles had claimed their tribute.
“I will tell some of my men to look after them,” he
explained, “and our surgeon will soon be here. Just
now he is busy on board the launches.”</p>

<p>“What? Have you been engaged, too?” asked
Warden.</p>

<p>“By Jove, we dropped in for the biggest surprise I
ever heard of. Just fancy being blazed at with Nordenfeldts
by niggers! Luckily for us, we came on
them unawares, and two of the canoes were headed
up&ndash;stream. The row that was going on here stopped
them from hearing the engines, or I must candidly
confess that if they had been ready for us they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
have sunk the flotilla before we came within striking
distance. As it was, they got in a few rounds that
raked a couple of boats fore and aft, before we got
busy with a Gatling. I suppose you didn’t catch the
racket on account of the dust up here.”</p>

<p>“But why in the name of wonder, are you here at
all?” demanded Warden.</p>

<p>“Well, my ship reported that a yacht called the <i>Sans
Souci</i> had landed a lot of arms and ammunition in a
creek in neighboring territories. That made the authorities
think a bit. But one of your fellows who accompanied
us told me that the real scare came when a
Mrs. Laing&mdash;she knows you, Warden, and she had
been living some weeks at Lokoja&mdash;was seized with
blackwater fever. She was pretty bad, so she sent
for the Commissioner to put her affairs in order.
Among other things, she warned him that some Portuguese
scoundrel was undoubtedly planning a rising
at Oku, and indeed all along the line of the Benuë
and right through Southern Nigeria. There had been
some rather curious ju&ndash;ju performances recently in a
few of the seaboard districts, so it was decided to
send a strong column up the Benuë to investigate
matters. We dropped detachments of Hausas at
every station we passed, and had intended halting
some miles below here to&ndash;night, when we heard the
drums going in the bush. Your Hausa man&mdash;Hudson
his name is&mdash;urged us to push on this far. Jolly
good job we did.”</p>

<p>“Has Mrs. Laing recovered?” asked Evelyn fearfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
The sailor hesitated a moment. He seemed
to leave something unsaid.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. She went under in a day. Sad thing.
I have never met her. An awfully nice woman,
Hudson says.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” sobbed Evelyn. “She was too young
to die, and she has not had much happiness in her
life.”</p>

<p>“Let there be no more talk of death&mdash;I am weary
of it,” said Warden cheerily, and he broke off into
Arabic.</p>

<p>“What sayest thou, Beni Kalli? Hast seen enough
of the black camel since we left Lektawa together?”</p>

<p>“Verily, Seyyid,” grinned the native. “I thought
you and I should mount him in company to&ndash;night.”</p>

<p>“Can you do me the exceeding favor of lending me
a suit of clothes?” said Warden, seeing that Bellairs
was about his own height.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Come down to my launch. We ought
to hold a council of war, I think. By the way, I suppose
the ladies will not stir out of this room till your
return.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Evelyn promptly. “We shall prepare
supper, but if you keep Captain Warden more than
half an hour I shall come for him.”</p>

<p>“You must remain here, sweetheart,” said the grim&ndash;looking
Arab. “There is a lot to be done outside.
Be sure I shall join you without delay. Come along,
Bellairs, and rummage your kit&mdash;there’s a good
chap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>As they crossed the compound together, the sailor
appeared to make up his mind to discharge a disagreeable
duty.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he said, “I hope I am not mixing
matters absurdly, but are you the Warden that Mrs.
Laing was once engaged to?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;more than ten years ago. What of it?”</p>

<p>“Well, she has left you everything she possessed&mdash;a
regular pile, somebody told me.”</p>

<p>“On condition that I do not marry Evelyn Dane, I
suppose?” said Warden, who treated the sailor’s
astonishing announcement as though the receipt of a
thumping legacy were an every&ndash;day affair.</p>

<p>“I haven’t heard anything of a fly in the amber,”
said Bellairs. “Hudson knows all about it&mdash;he will
be able to tell you.”</p>

<p>But Warden had no word to say to Hudson concerning
Rosamund Laing or her bequest. His mind
was too full of the greater wonder that Evelyn and he
should meet on the Benuë; that it had fallen to him
to snatch her from the clutches of the men of Oku.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pc1">THE SETTLEMENT</p>

<p class="p2">When Warden found that the expedition consisted
of a hundred sailors and over three hundred Hausas,
he was anxious that an advance should be made on
Oku at once. The town lay in a bush clearing on
high land overlooking the Benuë, not many miles
distant from the mission station. He argued that he
and Beni Kalli could guide the troops by the bush
paths, and that an attack carried out at dawn would
demoralize an enemy already shaken by an unforeseen
repulse at Kadana.</p>

<p>Every one admitted that he was right from the military
point of view; but Hudson, the political officer
accompanying the column, shirked the responsibility
of taking a step that implied the existence of a tribal
war. He argued that while they were fully justified
in driving off the assailants of the mission and in
demanding the punishment of those engaged in it,
together with the fullest compensation for loss of life
and property, yet they had no proof that the King of
Oku sanctioned the raid.</p>

<p>“When he refuses our terms,” he said, “we shall
destroy his town and depose him if he escapes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
his life. Under the circumstances, I cannot sanction
a forward movement until negotiations have failed.”</p>

<p>Bellairs, of course, had to take his orders from the
administration, and Warden had no power to over&ndash;ride
the man whom the Government had deputed to
visit Oku. He knew that Loanda, second only in
importance to M’Wanga, was among the slain. He
had seen M’Wanga himself exercising his savage
warriors day after day and taking care that they were
taught how to handle the modern weapons to which
they were unaccustomed. He was aware of the exact
date named for the rising, and was prevented only by
several weeks’ delirium of fever from stealing off down
stream in good time to warn the authorities. But he
was not in his own territory, for the Benuë runs through
Northern Nigeria while he was attached to the Southern
Protectorate, and, above all, he was a soldier, to whom
obedience was the first duty. So he refrained from
weakening Hudson’s position by demonstrating how
mistaken was the decision arrived at. He even hoped
that, in some mysterious way, matters might be adjusted
without further slaughter.</p>

<p>The proper course to adopt was to strike hard
and promptly. Failing that, he trusted to the strange
workings of the native mind to bring about a peaceful
settlement. Though strong in spirit he was broken
in body. He had done in five months that which a
few men had taken years to accomplish, while the
majority of those who essayed the task had failed,
and paid the penalty of failure by dying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>When the officers of the expedition gathered in the
mission that night and listened to his story, their minds
went back to the days of Mungo Park, and Clapperton,
and Lander, and Barth, and the rest of the famous
band of explorers who had traversed the wilds of
the West African hinterland during the close of the
eighteenth and the early years of the nineteenth centuries.</p>

<p>Nothing to equal Warden’s journey had been done
of recent years. It stood alone, a record of almost
unexampled fortitude and endurance.</p>

<p>He would never have reached the upper waters of
the Niger were it not for the blue cotton wrap taken
from the Prophet of El Hamra when that unamiable
person was left bound and gagged at Lektawa. So
deeply had the Blue Man’s repute penetrated into the
desert that among Mohammedan tribes the mere sight
of his robe was more powerful than an armed escort.
In a hasty search through the Prophet’s apartment,
Warden found his own revolver, two Remington repeating
rifles with a supply of cartridges, and a stock
of gold dust in quills, the most portable form of desert
currency. The blue rag supplied moral, the arms and
gold material aid, but the tremendous journey still
remained an undertaking fraught with every possible
danger. Not until the small party reached Timbuktu
could they regard themselves as possessing even a
moderate chance of ultimate success. In that city
Beni Kalli left his daughter with relatives. No consideration
would part him from the Seyyid. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
was a master worth serving, one who never thought
only of himself, but who was ready at any moment to
risk life or limb in aid of those who were faithful to
his interests. Moreover, he showed rare sport, and
Beni Kalli was a born adventurer.</p>

<p>So the pair came down the Niger, and, when Warden
learned that matters were quiet at Oku, he formed
the daring plan of preserving his incognito even from
the British officials at towns in the more settled regions.
He fancied that by maintaining his pose as an Arab
fire&ndash;brand he might venture to enter Oku itself. He
had spoken nothing but Arabic during so many months
that he was now far more glib in the language than
many genuine Arabs who could not boast his experience
of diverse tribes and varying dialects. He
deemed it best to let none know of his scheme. The
slightest hint that he had crossed the Sahara would
quickly find its way to Oku, and it was his safeguard
throughout that the Mahdi of the Atlas had sent him
to carry the fiery torch of Islam to the remotest strongholds
of the faith. Oku was frankly pagan, its people
cannibals when occasion served, but between them
and far&ndash;off Morocco lay the strong link of hatred of
the white man’s rule.</p>

<p>Evelyn listened in silence while her lover discoursed.
Her eyes shone and her lips were parted. More than
once, when some deft hint conveyed to her that his
thoughts dwelt ever with her, a tender little smile told
him that she understood.</p>

<p>Colville, who insisted on joining them when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
surgeon had dressed his injuries&mdash;for a ricochetting
bullet had torn a jagged wound in his shoulder as well
as broken his collar&ndash;bone&mdash;had heard from Lagos
something of the gourd. He asked Warden what had
become of it.</p>

<p>“It is among my belongings at Lagos,” he said.
“At least, I hope so. The skipper of the <i>Water Witch</i>
was a decent sort of fellow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is here,” said Evelyn quietly.</p>

<p>“Here!”</p>

<p>Half a dozen voices cried in concert, but she was
looking at Warden.</p>

<p>“You gave it to me at Cowes?” she went on.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I refused it. Well, when they told me at
Lagos that you were surely lost in the desert, I asked
for it. I&mdash;I&mdash;almost believed it would bring us
together again.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look at it,” chimed in Fairholme.</p>

<p>She was strangely reluctant at first, and her unwillingness
to produce that sinister carving was not to be
wondered at, for she had seen sufficient of the men of
Oku during the past few hours to disturb her dreams
for many a year. But Warden joined in the chorus
of persuasion, and she brought the canvas bag from
her room.</p>

<p>“Please open it,” she said to her lover. “I dare not.
Though I confess to an uncanny confidence in its
power, I am still afraid of it.”</p>

<p>He drew forth the calabash with a sudden movement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
hoping to startle some of the onlookers by the
extraordinary vitality of Domenico Garcia’s masterpiece,
but Evelyn alone was affected, and she uttered
a cry of dismay.</p>

<p>“It is ruined!” she exclaimed. “The moist heat has
destroyed the lacquer! Even the eyes have gone.
Oh, Arthur, please do throw it away this time. The
thing is dead!”</p>

<p>In her excitement she had used exactly the right
phrase. The man of Oku was dead, in fact decomposed.
His face had melted away, his mosaic eyes
had fallen out, the mocking smile worthy of a triumphant
demon had faded from his thick lips. In truth,
the mask on the gourd was a mere travesty of its former
self.</p>

<p>Warden was quite as bewildered as the girl.</p>

<p>“Well,” he cried, “that is really the most amazing
coincidence I have ever known. It knocks any of my
adventures into a cocked hat. Just think of it&mdash;this
thing lived, I tell you. It was a superb creature of
genius. It must have been found two hundred years
ago when some Portuguese or Spaniards looted Benin.
It was brought to England only to be lost in a sailing
ship that foundered on the east side of the Isle of
Wight. After passing a couple of centuries under the
sea, it bobbed up serenely one day last August, disturbed
from its resting&ndash;place when the Emperor’s
yacht struck the sunken wreck. I firmly believe it
was made within a few miles of this very place, yet it
survived through the ages until the hour when the Oku<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
power is broken for ever, and now it is destroyed.
Did you ever hear anything like it? Surely this is a
thing not dreamed of in our philosophy.”</p>

<p>None but Evelyn among those present could share
his opinion. It was impossible for any one who had
not seen the calabash on the deck of the <i>Nancy</i> to
picture the malign fascination of that graven face.</p>

<p>But Warden was convinced of his theory. To
please his lady, he bade Beni Kalli take the gourd and
throw it on the smoldering embers of the mission
huts. And so ended the pilgrimage of the grim contrivance
fashioned by Domenico Garcia to carry his
story to the world that had forgotten him. It perished
in the ashes of the old Kadana, on the site where a
new enterprise would soon mark the practical inception
of Hume’s day&ndash;dream.</p>

<p>Nor was the hour far distant when all in that room
remembered Warden’s emphatic words. Next day
came messengers from the King of Oku. His majesty
deplored the excesses caused by the evil counsels of
certain professors of ju&ndash;ju. These men, difficult to
control, were aided and abetted by a notorious Portuguese
half&ndash;caste, one Miguel Figuero to wit, who had
helped the Oku rebels by importing arms from foreign
territory and generally disturbing the peace of the
kingdom.</p>

<p>“I have now dealt with Figuero and the others,”
said M’Wanga through his envoys. “They will
trouble the land no further.”</p>

<p>He meant that he had nailed them to trees as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
guarantee of good faith, when, in the small hours of
the morning, he grew fully assured that his guns were
useless, his river flotilla captured, and his army broken
up. Unfortunately for the success of his sudden
conversion to British notions of law and order, that
which was only a minor disturbance in a native state
assumed the gravest political significance when a
number of troops of a foreign power crossed the border
at various points with the avowed object of restoring
peace to a province in which the armed might of
Britain was set at nought.</p>

<p>The strongest party of these unlooked&ndash;for allies
marched on Oku. Its commandant, Count von Rippenbach,
seemed to be intensely surprised when he
found the city in the grip of a British column, and its
king a prisoner awaiting trial by court&ndash;martial. He
was not only surprised, but intensely chagrined, and
was so unwilling to return to his own territory that
there were “alarums and excursions“ in various centers
of diplomacy before he swallowed his wrath, invited
the British officers to a farewell dinner, and marched
back to the Cameroons. M’Wanga was found guilty
of murder and high treason, and was duly hanged in
front of his own residence. Pana, the third of the
negro visitors to Cowes, was banished to St. Vincent,
and the clearance among the witch&ndash;doctors which
Lord Fairholme so ably initiated was carried a good
deal further.</p>

<p>Among the effects of the arch&ndash;plotter Figuero were
found documents of such highly inflammable nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
that they were promptly interned in the deepest dungeons
of the Record Office. But some of his belongings
had a more direct interest than state papers for
the two people with whose fortunes he was so curiously
bound up. Warden came across another copy of the
very page of the newspaper he bought at Cowes wherein
was described the accident to the imperial yacht. In
the same packet were an extract from Evelyn’s stolen
letter, in Rosamund Laing’s handwriting, several
complete letters written to him by the girl herself after
leaving Lochmerig, and his own long letter delivered
to her in Las Palmas by Peter Evans.</p>

<p>It amused him afterwards to enclose these <i>pièces
de conviction</i> and the scrap of tattooed skin with the
full report he was asked to send to the Colonial Office,
and there is reason to believe that an Under Secretary
for Foreign Affairs borrowed the said report for
perusal, and took it with him to wile away the tedious
hours of a week&ndash;end at the seaside ordered by his
doctor.</p>

<p>Warden and Evelyn were married at Old Calabar,
with Colville as best man and the Earl of Fairholme
<i>in loco parentis</i>. The bride’s dress was merely a
confection of white muslin, but she wore a ruby brooch,
roughly contrived by a native jeweler, that would
have evoked the envy of many a royal dame. The
finest wedding present to the happy pair was the
bequest of Rosamund Laing’s estate. Poor woman!
she had fenced in her gift with no restrictions. Indeed,
in her will she hinted at remorse, for she expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the hope that Arthur Warden would be happy with the
woman of his choice.</p>

<p>No one&mdash;least of all those acquainted with West
Africa&mdash;will be surprised to learn that Warden resigned
his commission when the affairs of Oku were
settled. His first care was to visit Lisbon, and insure
that the name of Domenico Garcia should never again
be forgotten in the memorial services for the dead,
while every year, in August, a special mass is sung in
the Cathedral of the Patriarch for the “repose of the
soul“ of the ill&ndash;fated artist. Two years later, Evelyn
and he were on board the <i>Nancy</i>, running into Falmouth
before a lively breeze, when Peter Evans pointed
to a steam yacht.</p>

<p>“There’s the old <i>San Sowsy</i>,” he said.</p>

<p>Evelyn instantly turned her binoculars that way.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, Peter,” she cried. “The Baumgartners
sold her before they went to South America.
She is like the <i>Sans Souci</i>, but that vessel’s name is
<i>Rover</i>.”</p>

<p>“Beggin’ your pardon, mum, but us pilots never
troubles about a craft’s name. W’y, I’ve known ‘em
to be re&ndash;christened w’en they was on’y fit for the extry
insurance of a castaway. That’s the <i>San Sowsy</i> right
enough. Chris, there’s a picter postcard of ‘er in my
locker. Fetch it, an’ we’ll run close alongside.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, you went to a yacht’s agent to get that
card for me when I forgot to note the <i>Sans Souci’s</i>
exact lines, although I was asked by the Under Secretary
to observe them carefully,” said Warden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s it, sir. It’s an old sayin’ an’ a true one&mdash;Keep
a thing ten years an’ it’ll come in useful at larst.”</p>

<p>“Fancy you forgetting anything, Arthur!” cried his
wife. “You are the one man in the world whom I
should never have suspected of missing an item like
that&mdash;it might have been so important.”</p>

<p>“Some places have a phenomenal effect on the
memory, my dear. I went to Plymouth with the
special object of jotting down all the <i>Sans Souci’s</i>
features, but I took a stroll on the Hoe, and my mind
at once became utterly obtuse to every consideration
save one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be silly! How could I guess you would
bring Peter’s postcard in evidence against me?”</p>

<p>But she blushed most delightfully, so the recollection
of that evening at Plymouth must have been very
pleasant, and present happiness is apt to shed its
golden light on the days that are past.</p>
